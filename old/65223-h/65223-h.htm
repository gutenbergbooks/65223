</div>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>



<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Oh!</span>&#8221; gasped Grandmother Capers, throwing
her hands upward with a gesture of dismay;
&#8220;oh, what a terrible infliction!&#8221; And she began
rocking herself violently to and fro, and screwing
her lips about in the manner which, with her,
always denoted extreme perturbation. Then she
glanced across the pleasant room to a lounge
and its occupant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope&mdash;it will not be that!&#8221; responded
Grandmother Kinsolving, feebly. She still held
the bomb-like telegram between her trembling
fingers, and was as yet too much overpowered by
the announcement it contained to have a better
answer ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is our own house, is it not, mother?&#8221;
demanded Aunt Ruth, with some asperity.</p>

<p>A voice from the lounge took up the conversation.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>&#8220;They can&#8217;t come here; that is all there is
about it. If they do, I shall leave.&#8221; The
speaker&#8217;s tone was decided and aggressive. It
caused the eyes of the other three persons in the
apartment to fasten themselves upon the fretful
face above the great pillows.</p>

<p>Only one of the three, however, had courage
to reply. That one was Aunt Ruth, who should
have been soft and yielding by nature had she
lived up to her name. But she did not; neither
did the plain garb of a Friend which she wore
appear to have its customary effect in subduing
the quick temper with which she had been
born.</p>

<p>&#8220;If thee wishes to leave, thee is at perfect
liberty to do so. The Kinsolving homestead
cannot open its doors to one branch of the family
and exclude another. Thee and thy kin are
welcome here; so is dear Content; so shall my
sister Lydia&#8217;s children be.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, which was even more determined
in tone than the invalid&#8217;s had been, Ruth Kinsolving
ended all remark upon the telegram, and
went away to answer it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;Grandmother, I shall not stay! I&mdash;I won&#8217;t
have everything upset by a lot of young ones!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, Melville! don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s a
dear. You know it is so bad for you. Besides,
I am sure that Grandmother Kinsolving will not
really take in such a lot of children to torment
us all with.&#8221; The old lady in the easy-chair
turned toward the one in the straight-back with
a cajoling expression.</p>

<p>But the lovely old Friend had had time to
regain her wonted calmness, and if the tone in
which she responded was gentle in the extreme,
it was also equally firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth has spoken the right word, though I
wish that she had done so more patiently. When
Oliver built this house he built it big and roomy.
&#8216;There must be space enough in it to hold all
our household and the children which shall come
after them,&#8217; he said. Lydia&#8217;s flock must find a
resting-place beneath the old roof-tree; but, if
they are anything like their mother before them,
they will not bring unhappiness to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>A quiet sadness stole over the placid features
under the snowy cap, and no one not utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
selfish would have disturbed the mistress of the
homestead by any further objection.</p>

<p>When the feeble lad, who absorbed as his
right so much of the family attention, again
began his impatient protest, Grandmother Kinsolving
rose and followed Ruth.</p>

<p>Then arose such a howl of distress as speedily
drove Grandmother Capers to the verge of hysterics
and brought Content flying in from the
orchard, where she had been writing a letter to
her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Melville! what has happened? Are you
worse,&mdash;suffering so terribly? Can I do anything
for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville ceased shrieking and broke into a subdued
roar, as ominous to his slave, Grandmother
Capers, as it was amusing to Content. But she
veiled the mirth in her brown eyes, and went on
speaking in that sort of soothing fashion which
mothers use to a fretful infant.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cripple became silent, and looked
up into his cousin&#8217;s face with an eagerness of expression
that showed how little real his grief had
been. &#8220;Say, Content, does Aunt Ruth know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
that my heart is affected, and that the doctor says
I must have perfect quiet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. You forget, Melville,
that I am almost a stranger to our aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but she&#8217;s your aunt, you know; you
ought to know her!&#8221; exclaimed the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I ought; but then, you see, I don&#8217;t.
I never saw her till last Thursday, as you
know; while you have lived with her for three
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hated her all that time!&#8221; cried Melville,
bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; laughed Content.</p>

<p>&#8220;True! I&mdash;I wish she&#8217;d die, or get
married!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Grandmother Capers was shocked at
this; and spoke reproachfully to her idol.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not say that, darling. Ruth is
a good woman. She means well, even if her
manner is unpleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville opened his lips to retort, but Content
was too loyal to allow this. &#8220;Why, Mrs.
Capers! Can you really think that? It seems
to me Aunt Ruth is so charming. She is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
delightfully honest and true. From the first
time I looked in her face I felt that I should be
safe and happy with her. And as for grandma,
I cannot tell you how lovely she appears to me.
Papa used to tell such wonderful stories of her
goodness that I was almost afraid to come and
live with her; I was sure I should shock her a
dozen times a day; but if I do she is too kind
to show it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Content! She thinks you are perfect.
She held you up as an example to me yesterday,
till I hated her almost as much as I do my aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into the midst of this mutual admiration talk
broke a sound which was even more startling
than the telegraph reading had been.</p>

<p>Clitter-ty-clatter! Yaw, whoop-la!</p>

<p>Melville raised himself upon his pillows,
Grandmother Capers screamed, and Content ran
to the window. Outside stood a tiny dog-cart,
drawn by a sturdy little pony, driven by a lad
who could not have seen more than eight summers,
though his face bore freckles enough to
have resulted from a dozen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried the licorice-stained mouth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the small teamster. &#8220;Is this my grandmother&#8217;s
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe; what is your grandmother&#8217;s name?&#8221;
said Content.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;I forget! It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;dang it!
Why ain&#8217;t Paula here! She knows everything,
and she&#8217;d know what it is. You see I came on
ahead; me and Pretzel here. Ain&#8217;t she a stunner?
Uncle Fritz give her to me&mdash;give me the
hull turnout. Say, do you live here? Have
you got a grandmother what&#8217;s an old Quaker
lady, and lives in a big homestead with pigs and
chickens and folks? Say, this is a big house,
ain&#8217;t it? I bet a cent this is the very place!
Won&#8217;t you just step in and ask if my grandmother
does live here? &#8217;Cause I&#8217;m all tuckered
out. This cart shook me up awful, comin&#8217; up
hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker paused from lack of breath,
and Content sprang through the low window-sash
and held out her arms to the little fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no need to go and ask, for I am sure
that you are my little cousin Fritz. Is it not
so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Yep. Anyhow, I&#8217;m Fritz; but who the
mischief are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Content; Content Kinsolving; aged
fifteen, and your Uncle Benjamin&#8217;s only child.
But where are the rest of your party? The
telegram said that all of Aunt Lydia&#8217;s children
were coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they be; when they get ready. Paula,&mdash;she&#8217;s
a stick,&mdash;she told Uncle Fritz that she
could not come till she had stopped to the hotel
and freshened herself. She&#8217;s always a freshening
herself, Paula is, but I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know
why, for she never does a blessed thing to get
herself messed. Octave, now&mdash;Octave, she is
a jolly one! she&#8217;s always messing, but she never
freshens. I like Octave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! most boys do like their sisters.
But come, come quickly to dear grandmother!
She will be so glad to see you!&#8221; and Content
slipped her arm fondly about the child&#8217;s waist,
as he still sat in the cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know? I&#8217;m a &#8216;terror,&#8217; Fritzy
Nunky says, unless I&#8217;m good. And the trouble
is, I can&#8217;t stay good. I can be delightful sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
for little short times; then I forget and
cut up. I used to try not to, but I&#8217;ve given it
up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The satisfied and aged expression which settled
upon the boyish face was funny in the extreme,
and Content laughed more heartily than
she had yet done since she parted with her
father at Osaka, in far-away Japan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she will &#8216;like&#8217; you; I do&#8221;; and she
kissed again the pretty, dirty face of the young
traveller, and lifted him out upon the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the stable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Around this way. Can you lead your
horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can, but I don&#8217;t want to. I&#8217;m tired.
Where&#8217;s the hostler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is none.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Fritz opened his big eyes. &#8220;What&#8217;ll we
do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lead him around to the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Content took hold of the bridle, but, small as
he was, this was more than the chivalrous nature
of little Fritz could allow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excoose me; but I&#8217;m the gentleman,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
said, with grave dignity, and took the bridle from
his cousin&#8217;s grasp.</p>

<p>She allowed him his will, finding in him something
so lovable that he was already assured of
one welcome in the household, no matter how
the rest might yet regard him.</p>

<p>One of the farm hands was just putting up the
stock for the night, and to him Fritz gave the
care of his new possession, with a matter-of-fact
manner which surprised the farmer into accepting
it without protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rub her down well, boy, and don&#8217;t drink her
till she&#8217;s cold. That&#8217;s what Fritzy Nunky said.
I don&#8217;t know much about horses myself, but I
do know that she isn&#8217;t a &#8216;him&#8217; like you called
her, Content,&#8221; laughed the tired little fellow,
slipping his warm hand into his cousin&#8217;s cool
clasp.</p>

<p>The &#8220;boy,&#8221; who was a gray-haired father of
many children, received the young horse owner&#8217;s
directions in silent amazement, and looked after
the pair as they left the barn-yard and entered
the kitchen as if he didn&#8217;t quite know whether
he should believe his own ears or not. Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
he gave a low whistle, and ejaculated: &#8220;Jimminetty!&#8221;
To him it appeared as if the self-possessed
child and his dashing little turnout had
dropped from the skies; but somehow he felt no
reluctance to rubbing the tiny mare &#8220;down well,&#8221;
as he had been ordered, nor did he attempt
to &#8220;drink her&#8221; until she was perfectly cool
and it was safe to let her plunge her velvet nostrils
into the trough of spring water at the barn-yard
gate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Content and the new arrival had
entered the mansion by the kitchen, and had,
after many pauses by the way, caused by the
guest&#8217;s curiosity, arrived at Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s
quiet room, where Aunt Ruth stood tying
on her gray bonnet, preparatory to going out
and dispatching her return message of welcome
to the guardian of her sister Lydia&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>Both mother and daughter stared at Content,
but for a moment each supposed she had picked
up her small companion from among the &#8220;boarders&#8221;
who frequented their mountain settlement,
and who strolled about over the pleasant roads
at all hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Well, and whom have you brought to visit
me now, Content?&#8221; asked grandmother, smiling
hospitably upon the little man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t thee guess, Grandma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she needn&#8217;t bother to guess. I&#8217;d just
as lief tell her. I&#8217;m your little grand-boy, I
reckon. Anyhow, I&#8217;m Fritzy Pickel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pickel! Not Pickel&mdash;not my daughter
Lydia&#8217;s Pickel?&#8221; cried the dear old lady, finding
this second shock almost too much for even her
credulity. It had been enough to receive that
unexpected telegram from Mr. Fritz Pickel, the
uncle and guardian of her dead daughter&#8217;s
family, announcing that he had, after a five
years&#8217; absence, returned to America, and had
brought all his wards with him, and expected, as
a matter-of-course, to leave them with their
maternal grandmother while he went journeying
about on a six months&#8217; business tour.</p>

<p>The telegram had not mentioned any time for
arriving, but the Kinsolvings had taken it for
granted that it would not be before the following
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! I suppose I am,&#8221; laughed Fritz,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
junior. &#8220;Fritzy Nunky says we&#8217;re quite a jar
full. He calls us &#8216;mixed pickles,&#8217; and says he
don&#8217;t know which he likes best, the sweet or
the sour. I say, are you my grandmother, truly?
&#8217;Cause you don&#8217;t look like grandmothers mostly
does. Lotta Hartmann, she had a grandmother,
and, my! I wouldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; kissed her for a cent.
But I&#8217;ll kiss you, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had Grandmother Kinsolving known it, she
was receiving the highest compliment little Fritz
ever bestowed upon any one; and she certainly
did &#8220;like,&#8221; for she opened her arms wide and
the boy flew to them with a swift response of
love in his generous little heart.</p>

<p>So there was welcome number two, or three;
for the farmer at the barn may be counted upon
as having given his in his undemonstrative way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> a hubbub as ensued in the old homestead
on the top of Deer Hill mountain, when, a
half-hour later, &#8220;Fritzy Nunky&#8221; arrived with his
other charges, would baffle description; for the
kindly German was one of those overflowing,
effervescing mortals who go bouncing through
the world as if their only mission were to &#8220;stir
up&#8221; other quieter folk. But it was such a
happy, generous stirring up that they who had
once experienced it generally desired to have it
again.</p>

<p>He was idolized by his nieces and his small
nephew, to whom he stood in place of the half
remembered parents, who had perished in a
steamship disaster the last time they had left
Germany to visit the mother&#8217;s native land. For
their sakes he had never married, lest his devotion
to them should have to be less; and he had
persistently done his utmost to spoil them, so far
as unlimited indulgence tends that way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Only to Paula he was a trial,&mdash;Paula, the
eldest of the brood, who had artistic and literary
tendencies; and who, having reached the mature
age of sixteen, felt that she had wisdom and
experience sufficient to sit in judgment on all
her &#8220;betters.&#8221; Strangely enough, &#8220;Fritzy
Nunky&#8221; appeared to agree with her, and if there
was one person of whom his sunshiny nature
stood in awe it was of Fr&auml;ulein Paula Pickel.</p>

<p>On Paula&#8217;s pretty features, then, there rested
an expression of grave disapproval during that
supper which followed the arrival of the stranger
grandchildren; for Uncle Fritz was so lost in
admiration of his lovely old hostess, and so
relieved to find The Snuggery such a delightful
home for his darlings, that he was even more
boisterous than ever.</p>

<p>Had Grandmother Capers and her invalid
been present, there is no knowing what might
have happened; but as soon as the noise of
their arrival reached Melville&#8217;s sitting-room, he
had caused word to be sent to Grandmother
Kinsolving that supper for himself and Mrs.
Capers must be served apart from the others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>The gentle old hostess had been rather glad of
this than otherwise, but Aunt Ruth, Friend as
she was, had tossed her shapely head with a
quaint air of disdain which boded a certain piece
of her mind to be delivered at the fitting occasion
and in the hearing of the two Capers.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, and my little jar of &#8216;mixed pickles&#8217; will
season your quiet life finely. And it amazes
me that you two ladies should live here in this
great house alone, with this young Fr&auml;ulein!&#8221;
exclaimed Uncle Fritz, sweeping his eyes over
the feminine trio, whom he supposed constituted
the family at the The Snuggery.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, it is not alone, Fritzy Nunky,&#8221; corrected
Paula, severely. &#8220;Our Aunt Ruth has
told you twice already that a Mrs. Capers and
our cousin Melville, her grandson, are also members
of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! so? Then I beg Miss Ruth&#8217;s sweet
pardon. Paula finds me ever a blunderer, dear
madam,&#8221; he concluded, looking deprecatingly
toward the hostess&#8217;s sympathetic face.</p>

<p>Grandmother Kinsolving smiled. &#8220;Thee is a
blunderer of the happy sort, then, Fritz. I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
understand now why my Lydia used to speak of
her brother-in-law with such affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it so?&#8221; queried Uncle Fritz, his big blue
eyes filling at mention of the dead woman who
had been a true sister to him. &#8220;And, but
we thought not of the &#8216;in-law.&#8217; Franz was
always deep in my heart&#8217;s love, and when Lydia
came, she nestled close beside him. Christina,
there, is the mother made anew for us. Thou
wilt find comfort in little Christina,&#8221; he added
fondly, laying his broad hand on the flaxen
braids of his youngest niece, who blushed and
smiled gratefully at the commendation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of me, Fritzy Nunky? Am I
not a comfort, also?&#8221; asked the tall Octave,
demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Praise goes unsought, sweetheart. It never
answers to bidding, thou witch! Octave will
make thee great care, Frau Kinsolving. She has
a big heart and a head full of heedless ways.
Octave is my brother Franz, as little Christina
is my sister Lydia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the grave tenderness fell upon the
spirits of those who best remembered the dead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Content felt herself almost an alien, since all were
strangers to her save the grandmother and aunt
whom she had known but three short days. A
moment&#8217;s longing for her own absent father who
was the one son of the house stole over her, and
she turned her eyes westward through the open
window, as if looking toward him brought her
nearer to the missionary in far-away Japan.</p>

<p>But there was no division in Amy Kinsolving&#8217;s
heart, and the lonesome look of her little Content
touched her heart, as she leaned forward to lay
her hand kindly upon the girl&#8217;s slender one. &#8220;A
strange reunion, Fritz; a strange ruling of Providence
that all my children&#8217;s children should have
been brought to the old nest at one and the same
time. Benjamin has sent us his motherless Content,
that we may rear her to good and housewifely
ways; Harriet&#8217;s poor crippled lad and his
paternal grandmother have dwelt with us these
three years; and now thee comes bringing a
whole&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jar of mixed pickles!&#8221; interrupted Octave,
with no intention of disrespect, but in the heedlessness
which was her characteristic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Octave!&#8221; cried Paula; &#8220;apologize to grandmother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apologize yourself!&#8221; retorted Octave,
pertly; then blushed furiously, remembering to
whom she had been discourteous. &#8220;I do apologize,
dear, sweet little grandma. Not for Paula&#8217;s
tongue, though, but because I wouldn&#8217;t do a
shabby thing to you if I could help it. But I
never shall do any better; I&#8217;m born to be
horrid,&#8221; she concluded with such complacent
serenity that Content laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you laughing at?&#8221; demanded Fritz,
junior, stopping his noisy consumption of a third
bowl of milk. &#8220;I like to know all the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you would not understand this;
but I was not laughing at any one,&#8221; returned
Content, flushing a bit at her lack of self-control.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can tell, can&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ve got a
tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, it struck me as very funny that
Octave and your own small self have already
decided that there is no use in trying to improve
yourselves, and are so perfectly satisfied that it
should be so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Fritzy&#8217;s puzzled little face, after this long
explanation, showed that he had not comprehended
it as well as he expected; but a swift,
keen glance from Octave&#8217;s dark eyes intercepted
one from Content, and a bond of interest was
instantly formed between these two stranger
cousins whose training had been so different.</p>

<p>Fritz slipped down from his chair, when he had
at length filled himself to the utmost capacity
with his Aunt Ruth&#8217;s good things, and sauntered
carelessly out of the room. No one thought to
forbid his exploring any part of the house which
attracted his curiosity, and Aunt Ruth disdained,
while Grandmother Amy forgot, Melville&#8217;s fretful
request that he should not be disturbed by
any family visits that night.</p>

<p>Melville Capers was accustomed to consider
his word as law, and for the sake of peace it
generally was such. His anger and astonishment
then was great when, as he had just
composed himself for a nap, the door of his
sitting-room opened, and a small person in dusty
knickerbockers walked coolly in.</p>

<p>The fourteen-year-old boy on the sofa had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
voice suited to a man, or at least to a youth of
much stronger physical development than its
owner&#8217;s, and when this voice demanded in its
fiercest tones, &#8220;Why are you intruding here?&#8221;
it surprised, if it did not intimidate, the visitor.</p>

<p>Now old Oliver Kinsolving had been, according
to his neighbors&#8217; dictum, &#8220;a man of a great
substance&#8221;; which meant not so much substance
of money, though he was rich enough, but rather
substance of character, will power, honesty, and
kindliness. It was curious to note how each of
his descendants possessed at least one factor
of their grandsire&#8217;s &#8220;substance,&#8221; to wit, his
will; and little Fritz, though he was the smallest
of the flock, was yet to demonstrate that he
inherited not the smallest share of this same
quality.</p>

<p>The child had said to himself, as he left the
dining-room, that he would see every nook and
cranny of the big, new home before he went to
sleep that night. He was not, therefore, to be
balked of his project simply because a big boy on
a lounge roared at him. His momentary hesitation
vanished, and his retort came so promptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
that no hesitation had really been perceived by
the questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t intruding; I&#8217;m &#8217;specting of my grandmother&#8217;s
house. I should like to know who you
are, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you who I am if you don&#8217;t get
out of here pretty sudden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Who&#8217;s afraid?&#8221; demanded Fritz,
coolly and impudently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You. Five seconds, now! Then get!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&mdash;cripple as I am,&mdash;if you don&#8217;t
leave here instanter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cripple? That&#8217;s a boy without feet or
hands. I seed one once at the Museum in
Munich. My! but he wasn&#8217;t like you. He had
a voice. Cracky! how that crippler did sing!
You cripple, can you sing, too, as well as
holler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear out, I tell you! You infernal little
imp!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t a imp. Imps goes down traps and
holes in theatres. I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em. Ginger! ain&#8217;t
you a cross-looking boy?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The child had come fearlessly forward, and was
bestowing upon the invalid a critical scrutiny,
which naturally made its sensitive recipient writhe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear out, quick! or I&#8217;ll throw this book at
your head!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dassent!&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer the volume of Dickens with which
Melville had been passing away his tedious afternoon,
whizzed past the intruder&#8217;s curly pate.</p>

<p>In an instant all his fiery temper had roused.
The child was used only to kindness and indulgence;
his few &#8220;fights&#8221; had been with poor
children on the city street in that distant home
in Germany, and he had never attempted one
with &#8220;an equal.&#8221; His little chest swelled, his
head tossed back, his voice took on a new tone.
&#8220;You coward, you! If I had Fritzy Nunky&#8217;s
Winchester here, I&#8217;d blow your head right square
off you! You&mdash;you&mdash;mean thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and pound you! That is, if you can&#8217;t
get off your old lounge!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; sneered Melville, little dreaming
that his menace would be accepted.</p>

<p>But it was; and in another second the round,
dirty fists of little Fritz were beating and punching
the face and sides of the really helpless
invalid. Melville defended himself as best he
could, and cried aloud for his grandmother.
But that unsuspecting woman was taking her
evening constitutional at a good distance from
the house, and did not hear him.</p>

<p>As he saw his adversary evidently weakening
the belligerent Fritz felt his courage grow apace,
and he became quite carried away with his own
prowess.</p>

<p>But after a considerable interval, he realized
that his blows were no longer parried, and that
Melville&#8217;s claw-like hands lay supinely on the
robe which half covered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Thought I couldn&#8217;t lick you,
didn&#8217;t you? And I showed you diffrunt!
Humph! Got enough, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; And with
immeasurable contempt Fritz stepped back and
regarded the motionless figure upon the lounge.
He stood thus for a long, long time; then suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the memory of a story his uncle had told
him of a boy who killed his brother in a &#8220;fight&#8221;
rushed into his mind.</p>

<p>Had he killed this boy of the roaring voice?
A quick little sob escaped his babyish lips, and
in an awful terror he turned and fled.</p>

<p>They were just rising from their long, after
table talk when the door of the supper-room
opened furiously, and a small boy with a very
white face appeared on its threshold. The big,
staring eyes and the quivering lips did not seem
to belong to their little Fritz, and every one
paused in expectation, as he cried in his terrified
treble: &#8220;There&#8217;s a homely, great boy on a
lounge, and I&#8217;ve just killed him!&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Fritz!</span> Fritzy Pickel! What is that you
say?&#8221; demanded Uncle Fritz, who of all the
astonished company was the first to recover his
speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead! Dead as Otto Skaats!&#8221; wailed
the terrified child. &#8220;I fit him and beat him;
but I didn&#8217;t&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean to do it so hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Otto Skaats&#8221; had been the unlucky hero of
Uncle Fritz&#8217;s doleful tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to me, nephew!&#8221; ordered Uncle Fritz
sternly, and the little boy sorrowfully obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell Fritzy Nunky every single thing.&#8221;
Mr. Pickel sat down upon the sofa and took his
favorite into the safe shelter of his arms. Sympathy,
he knew, was the shortest road to confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to see the house, and I found a boy.
He was big and crosser than anything. He
couldn&#8217;t be my truly cousin, Fritzy Nunky,
&#8217;cause he wasn&#8217;t a gentleman. He ordered me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
out of his place like he owned the hull concern;
and he dasted me to fight. I wanted to lick
him, and I did; but I didn&#8217;t &#8217;spect to kill
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the recollection of Melville&#8217;s white face, the
young pugilist hid his own on Uncle Fritz&#8217;s broad
shoulder and began sobbing as if his heart were
broken.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at that moment Aunt Ruth re-entered
the room. She had waited to hear but
the first words of the little lad&#8217;s self-accusation,
and had then flown swiftly to Melville&#8217;s side.
For an instant she had gazed upon the inert
figure, horrified, and actually believing that the
tale was true. Another instant, and she resisted
the thought as something too terrible to have
really come into such quiet lives as theirs. She
found the death-like stupor only a faint after all;
and her heart gave a great throb of thankfulness.
She had never loved, and was far too honest to
pretend affection for, her elder nephew; but in
that moment she realized the truth of the old
saying that &#8220;blood is thicker than water.&#8221; She
had not loved him simply because he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
lovable; but a hope arose within her that he
might yet become so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been too severe with him, no doubt,&#8221;
said truthful Ruth to herself; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve had too
great contempt for his supreme selfishness. But
who knows? Maybe in his place I should have
been a deal more disagreeable&mdash;if that were
possible!&#8221;</p>

<p>This soliloquy had not hindered the work of
her capable hands, and very speedily she had
the satisfaction of seeing the invalid revive.
When he recovered so far as to answer her question,
he replied, that &#8216;he was all right, only his
head felt queer.&#8217; &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember what
happened to me. Oh, yes, I do too! Where
is that little imp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! thee&#8217;ll live!&#8221; replied Aunt Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Live? Why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; demanded Melville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee has just had a pretty serious thrashing,
and, I fancy, the first one of thy experience.
Little Fritz must have hit thy temple, for I see it
is discolored. The blow in that particular place
was what made thee faint, I suppose.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;Now will you insist upon keeping him
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy as dangerous as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melville Capers, I am ashamed of thee!
Even if thee is an invalid it is no reason why
thee should be a coward! It does not seem as
if there could be one drop of Kinsolving blood
in thy veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville was still weak, and he was too utterly
astonished at his aunt&#8217;s indignation to reply.
He lay staring at her until a well-known step was
heard in the passage and Grandmother Capers
came into the room. Then ensued the customary
roar with which the cripple expressed his
disapprobation of things in general and of this
latest grievance in especial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boohoo! Row row-wow-ow!&#8221; No written
word can convey the sound; it made quick-tempered
Ruth think of nothing but an angry
calf, and the pity which had sprung up in her
heart gave way to disgust.</p>

<p>So it was with a very contemptuous expression
on her fair face that she re-entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
supper-room, where Grandmother Kinsolving sat
trembling, and herself on the verge of fainting,
while the younger ones had grouped themselves
about Uncle Fritz and his sobbing burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked that gentleman, eagerly,
though already relieved by Ruth&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly well! Or, rather, perfectly safe.
Doubtless Melville does feel a bit the worst for
being knocked senseless, but he is sufficiently
himself again, <i>I</i> think!&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this with the funniest little emphasis
on the &#8220;I,&#8221; and the young Pickels&#8217; curiosity
was whetted. The more, indeed, that this odd
new aunt of theirs at that instant held up her
hand to make them listen. The wailing and
roaring penetrated even to that remote apartment,
and caused Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s
sweet face to flush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth, thee should not! Remember the lad
is thy own nephew. He is frail, and not to be
judged by common rules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, because he is of our own blood,&mdash;which
I find it hard to believe,&mdash;I want all these
new children of ours to understand him at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
outset. Thee is always fond of having things
&#8216;start right,&#8217; and I have caught thy habit.&#8221;
The tender look in the daughter&#8217;s eyes corrected
any possible rudeness in her speech; and, seriously
she was in earnest about having the new
family &#8220;start right.&#8221;</p>

<p>For three years Melville had been a terrible
trial to her; the worse because she saw only too
plainly that his suffering, which was real enough
at times, and his wretched disposition, were
wearing her mother&#8217;s strength away. Ruth Kinsolving
felt, and rightly, that one such life as
Amy Kinsolving&#8217;s was worth more to the world
than dozens like Melville&#8217;s; and she hoped from
this inrush of young life that household matters
might be straightened out.</p>

<p>When Content came to them, it had been after
long objection on her aunt&#8217;s part; which, however,
the girl herself did not know. But when
Benjamin wrote about his &#8220;only, motherless
child,&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose had tilted itself a
little higher, and her firm mouth had closed a
little more firmly. For her part, she had had
quite enough of &#8220;only children,&#8221; no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
close their kinship, nor how orphaned their
state.</p>

<p>Grandmother Amy had said very little, and
had said that little gently; but, meek as she was,
she was also wise; and much as she leaned upon
her capable daughter, she had never let go the
reins of management from her own fragile hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee will do thy duty, Ruth, as thee has
been trained to do. Benjamin and Benjamin&#8217;s
belongings have as much right in The Snuggery
as thee has. If there were a dozen children
and he wished me to receive them, I should bid
him send them. Since there is only one, and
that a girl, I look to thee to be her second
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth reserved her own opinion about the
mothering part, but she obediently wrote the
letter of welcome; and was glad to her heart&#8217;s
core when its living answer looked up into her
eyes with a gaze as fearless and honest as her
own and with far more of sweetness.</p>

<p>Having been so agreeably disappointed in
Content, she was prepared to welcome the little
Pickels with greater cordiality; and she formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
a project, then and there, that the family should
make one united effort to reconstruct poor Melville,
and make him a credit to them.</p>

<p>So, taking little Fritz from his uncle&#8217;s arms,
she led the party into the south room, where
through the open windows the moonlight fell as
she fancied it could fall only on Deer Hill, and
there she told them Melville&#8217;s short and painful
history.</p>

<p>Ellison Capers had brought distress upon the
family hearth from the first time his shadow
rested there. She entered into few details, thinking
it unwise that listeners so youthful should
yet learn them; but she showed them that her
sister Harriet had died none too soon to hide
her broken heart, and that through the curse of
his own father&#8217;s dissipation had come poor Melville&#8217;s
ruined, crippled life. Whether he had
fallen or been thrown from his father&#8217;s arms, when
that father was intoxicated, they never knew;
but they did know that from that fall dated all
the son&#8217;s suffering. There was something wrong
with the spine, but a trouble which as yet no
physician had ever been able to set right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Unconsciously to herself, as she talked, Aunt
Ruth&#8217;s voice took on a tone of soft and womanly
pity, and it did not seem to those who listened
as if she could ever have spoken of her nephew
so contemptuously as they had heard her speak
a little while before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this other &#8216;Grandmother Capers?&#8217;
Cannot she do anything to make him bear his
trouble better?&#8221; asked Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she can, she does not. Ellison was her
only son, and of course our invalid is her only
grandchild. Her idea of love appears to be
unlimited indulgence&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here poor &#8220;Fritzy Nunky&#8221; began to glance
about uneasily, but Ruth&#8217;s next words showed
him that nothing personal had been intended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I wasn&#8217;t thinking of thee, sir. I fancy
that thee can say no&mdash;once in a way, if need be.
But Mrs. Capers cannot. She is, unfortunately,
very wealthy, and she has let Melville know that
all she has will one day be his. That he may
not live to inherit appears never to occur to
either of them. The boy is utterly spoiled; and
if he were any older I should give him up as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
hopeless. But he is only fourteen, and very
clever-witted,&mdash;though it might not seem probable
to those who hear him bray so!&#8221;</p>

<p>A renewed sound of woe or wrath warned
them that Grandmother Capers was in for a
tussle with her charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth! Ruth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The noise <i>is</i> certainly like that Don makes,
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Don?&#8221; asked Fritzy, suddenly sitting
up straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a donkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he live here, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He is very old. Thy dear mother and
I used to ride him once upon a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may ride him, mayn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can he tell? Does he talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a very expressive way of making
people understand his likes and dislikes. Thee
shall try him to-morrow. Thee can hardly keep
thy eyes open now, and we will go up to see how
fresh and sweet grandmother&#8217;s sheets do smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz, junior, immediately climbed down, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
slipped his hand within his aunt&#8217;s. It was evident
that they two would speedily understand
each other. And Ruth&#8217;s quick feeling was deeply
touched, when, as the sleepy little fellow knelt
down to say his &#8220;good-night word to God,&#8221; he
begged that trusted Father to &#8216;forgive him for
killing the crippler&#8217;; &#8220;no, for not killing him&#8221;&mdash;he
went on; &#8220;oh! I don&#8217;t know what I mean; but
God does every time, Fritzy Nunky says.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the unwise if earnest woman had inaugurated
a work the magnitude of which was doomed
to make even her valiant spirit quake. She returned
to the south room to find all its young
occupants deep in the discussion of Melville&#8217;s
reformation; and each with a different and distinct
plan for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>Grandmother had gone to sit with her invalid,
and Uncle Fritz was resting on the sofa. None
of the earnest talkers heeded her entrance, or
were conscious of it; but when she had quietly
listened to the varying projects, and the unmistakable
quality of the family &#8220;substance&#8221; with
which each was advocated, her courage failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight him out on his own line!&#8221; declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the tomboy Octave; &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach him that he
has got to be a man and not a baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Paula, with scorn; &#8220;Nothing can
be done by being unladylike. I am going to
treat him as if we were grown-up folks. A gentleman
should be ashamed to cry like a child.
I&#8217;ll teach him German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what I can do,&#8221; said
Christina; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll do something! He shall
not worry my sweet, new grandmother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there must be unity, my dears,&#8221; said
Aunt Ruth, joining in the talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8216;Fritzy Nunky,&#8217; as you call him, hasn&#8217;t
said his word yet,&#8221; added Content. &#8220;Suppose
we try and find out what he would suggest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to bed!&#8221; retorted the guardian of
many Pickels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Nunky! How would you, if you
were going to be here, how would you reform
the horrid fellow?&#8221; demanded Octave, imperiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Well, I should just try loving him.&#8221;
And with that wisest project of all, the conclave
broke up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I have</span> stirred up a hornet&#8217;s nest, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth! Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a mental one, dear. Thee must not
take me too literally. But I unwisely asked
Lydia&#8217;s children to help me in trying to improve
Melville, and they responded only too briskly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the daughter related what she had overheard
in the south room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Fritz was the only one in the right of
it,&#8221; was Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s brief comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can one love what is not lovable? I
have been trying three years, and thee knows I
have not succeeded over well,&#8221; answered Ruth,
soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think thee has tried less to love than to
make, daughter. Just thee leave off the making
part, and follow Fritz Pickel&#8217;s good advice. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
thee will be the example to the children that thee
should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another way out of it, mother dear.
Margaret Capers and Melville are always threatening
to &#8216;leave,&#8217; when things do not move just
to their notion. Now we have a good reason for
letting them keep their word. The peace which
would follow their going would be balm to my
soul, and marrow to your bones, Mother Amy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady did not notice the remark, but
went on putting away her gray silken gown as
carefully as if it were not to be taken out and
worn again on the morrow. Then she folded her
snowy kerchief and placed it in its own appropriate
drawer of the old-fashioned chiffonier,
smoothing out every wrinkle with a lingering
daintiness of touch that seemed a sort of ceremony
to the less careful Ruth, who enjoyed
nothing better than to watch her mother dressing
and undressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be a vanity in all that fussiness,
if it were any one but thee who was guilty of it,
Mother Amy,&#8221; said the younger, busier woman,
fondly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;If thee would spend more time over thy
clothes and less over the household cares, thee
would not get so weary, Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother! I never told thee I was
weary!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tone of thy voice tells it, dear. I know
that this opening our doors to so many new cares
will fall heaviest on thee, my child. Thee must
watch thyself, betimes, and be beforehand with
love. That will oil the wheels and make them
move noiselessly. One thing I foresee gladly.
Thee will find enough in little Fritz to make up
to thee for all thy labor for him. Yet he is a
child born to mischief. And I think thee will
have less time to worry over Melville, now this
other nephew has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do love him already. Who could
help it? He seems a typical boy,&mdash;healthy,
hearty, and roguish, but warm-hearted and chivalrous
as well. I&#8217;ll put up with Paula for the
sake of Fritzy. Bless the little man! I should
like to spank Paula. What a contrast to Content!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will do each other good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;But, mother, what about the Capers? If
they wish to go, had we not better let them?
Thee knows it is not for the need of their board
money we keep them; and now these other
natural claims are made upon thee, thee can say
we want the three extra rooms, as indeed we do.
I was ashamed to put Fritz Pickel into such a
pigeonhole as the little room under the stairs,
and it was all there was left to offer him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritz Pickel will do very well if he has always
such a comfortable and cleanly bed to rest him
on; and it is not he who is troubled, but thy own
housewifely heart. Go now to sleep, my child.
On thee will fall the burden of the day, and thee
must rest. All that the past day has brought to
our door, that will we keep; and because of the
new bringing we will not discard the old.&#8221;</p>

<p>So dismissed, and understanding perfectly that
her mother&#8217;s determination was final, Ruth Kinsolving
went to her own chamber to lie awake
and borrow anxiety, as was her nature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the victim of that evening&#8217;s discussion
tossed fretfully on his own luxurious bed&mdash;by
far the most comfortable one the everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
comfortably furnished house afforded.
He knew nothing, of course, of the eager plans
for his reformation which his cousins, &#8220;the
intruders,&#8221; had laid; but he was perfectly
capable of forming plans on his own side, not
indeed for the reformation of the enemy but for
its utter extirpation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are enemies, the whole posse of them.
The little imp is but a sample of the lot. Of
that I am positive. But if they think they are
going to bully me, just because I am a sick boy,
they&#8217;ll find themselves mightily mistaken. If I
can&#8217;t fight with my fists I can with my brain, and
I will make that whole batch of Pickels sorry
they ever heard of The Snuggery. I will so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What did you say, darling?&#8221;
asked Grandmother Capers, who entered from
her own apartment in swift anxiety. She boasted
that she always slept with one eye open, and
Melville, at least, believed her. Wake when and
how he would, her quick ear caught the difference
in his breathing, and she was at his side,
attentive and submissive.</p>

<p>Grandmother Capers was considered a &#8220;worldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
old woman,&#8221; by those who felt themselves
competent to judge; and, indeed, she was a
great contrast to Grandmother Kinsolving, as
well in her speech and faith as in her personal
appearance. But whatever might be her mental
or moral weaknesses, in one thing she was strong;
and that was in her supreme, untiring devotion
to her grandson. It seemed to Amy Kinsolving
as if Ellison&#8217;s mother was seeking, by the consecration
of her every faculty to Ellison&#8217;s child, to
make up to him for the terrible injury he had
suffered at his parent&#8217;s hands. If the devotion
wearied Melville, he was still so accustomed to it
that he would scarcely have known how to exist
without it.</p>

<p>But he resented it as if it had been an insult.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish that I could ever move without
your eternal asking: &#8216;What is it, darling?&#8217; I
hate the sound of your voice!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Caper&#8217;s dark eyes filled with tears, and
the pretty pink color on her round, old cheek
deepened; but Melville could not see this, and, if
he had been able, he would not have cared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I disturbed you, dear; but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
better that than that you should need me and I
not be at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady&#8217;s tone was apologetic and humble&mdash;a
tone which, whenever Ruth Kinsolving
heard it, made her blood boil. That anyone
of her race should force such a tone into the
voice of an aged woman was one of the many
hard things she had to endure on account of her
elder nephew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, see that you don&#8217;t do it again, then!
And go to bed, can&#8217;t you? I wish you&#8217;d shut
the door between. If I could walk a step, I&#8217;d
soon find a way to keep you out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, sweetheart, don&#8217;t you worry!
You know it is so bad for you. If you want
me, don&#8217;t fail to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little fear that this would ever happen,
but it was a tender injunction which Grandmother
Capers never failed to give.</p>

<p>She returned to her own bed, and fell into
another &#8220;cat nap,&#8221; from which she was roused
again, after a brief interval, by hearing Melville
breathing deeply and in a manner to startle anybody
even less doting than she. Quietly as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
mouse, fearing further rebuff, the old lady crept
forward until she could peer through the doorway.</p>

<p>Melville was not asleep. He was sitting as
nearly upright in bed as he was able to do, and
his eyes were fixed upon the open window, and
the moonlight which he loved, and which, though
against his faithful nurse&#8217;s judgment, he insisted
should never be shut out by curtains.</p>

<p>The moonlight? Something far whiter and
brighter than that. Something which moved up
and down, up and down, slowly and monotonously.</p>

<p>Grandmother Capers&#8217;s eyes followed her grandson&#8217;s,
and for the first time in her life she became
oblivious to his existence.</p>

<p>Even in modern America there are some
houses old enough to have ghostly traditions,
and The Snuggery was one of these. On certain
nights of the midsummer, when the moon was
at its full, &#8220;spirits were seen to walk,&#8221; through
the box-bordered garden-paths; and to sway
rhythmically, like folks in &#8220;meeting,&#8221; above the
shaven lawn. These old tales had always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
recounted, but it was not until within the last
five years, and since the ocean shipwreck which
had brought such heart shipwreck to the old
homestead, that some voices whispered knowingly
how one of these wandering spirits was
that of the drowned daughter of the house.</p>

<p>What more fitting, then, than that, on the very
first night of their arrival here, the ghost of the
children&#8217;s mother should revisit the home of her
childhood and now of theirs?</p>

<p>Grandmother Capers did not for one instant
question the evidence of her senses. She was
credulous by nature, and somewhat ignorant,
despite her many years, and she remained spellbound
where she had paused.</p>

<p>Up and down, up and down, the tall slim
creature of the upper air moved, as if blown
about by the wind. Grandmother did not have
on her spectacles, but she was moderately sharp
of vision still; and she was sure that the ghost
had long blonde hair and blue eyes. So had
Lydia Kinsolving, in the days of her youth.</p>

<p>Then the watcher became conscious that it
was not an aimless tossing of ethereal substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
that made the light wind&#8217;s sport; there was
motion, and method in the motion, which seemed
strangely familiar to Margaret Capers. Oddly
enough, the days of her own youth and belleship
recurred to her; days in which she had danced
in stately waltzes as unlike the modern ones as
grace is unlike awkwardness.</p>

<p>She forgot to be afraid, remembering so distinctly.
She forgot that it was said to presage
evil if one unwittingly paused to watch a
&#8220;spirit.&#8221; She forgot everything but the waltz
movement which had once been dearer to her
giddy soul than food to her healthy body. She
leaned forward, entranced; but when, presently,
the ghostly dancer began to sing, in time to her
own motion, the very words of a love-song Margaret
Capers had often sung, the fascinated
observer aroused with a start.</p>

<p>It was her warning! She knew it, recognized
it! She uttered a terrified shriek, so piercing
that it silenced Melville from responding, and
brought Aunt Ruth flying, like another ghost, in
her long nightgown to the invalid&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>But when she beheld Grandmother Capers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
gazing distraught and horror-stricken through
the open window, her glance followed swiftly
after.</p>

<p>And with her own bodily eyes, in a sickening
fear utterly new to her, Ruth Kinsolving looked
upon what she actually believed to be her own
sister&#8217;s wraith.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> is, for one brief, ridiculous moment she
so believed. Then, with a blush at her own
credulity, Aunt Ruth speedily hurried out of
doors and laid her energetic mortal hand upon
the specter&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paula! Paula Pickel! What in the name of
common-sense is thee doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as it was something rather in the nature
of uncommon-sense, Paula did not immediately
answer.</p>

<p>A second, more vigorous shake awoke the
young somnambulist, though to a dazed and unsatisfactory
condition which was as puzzling to
Aunt Ruth as the whole episode was. But
the girl gradually came to herself, and her first
exclamation cleared the ghostly mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! Have I been walking in my sleep
again?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;I should say thee had,&#8221; retorted the aunt,
feeling very decidedly provoked at having so
many people disturbed. &#8220;Thee has frightened
Grandmother Capers half to death with thy uncanny
dancing. Come now, at once, and show
her who and what thee is. Then, maybe, the old
lady can get a bit of rest. Between thee and
Melville it will be little enough at the most.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paula resented her aunt&#8217;s tone and manner:
she acknowledged no authority except her own
will, and, occasionally, that of her Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to speak like that to me&mdash;none
whatever. Besides, I am not going to meet
a stranger in this dishabille. I am sorry that I
walked in my sleep, but I am not to blame for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girl drew herself stiffly away from
the firm touch which still held her shoulder, and
with an air of offended dignity started to re-enter
the house.</p>

<p>Ruth released her clasp, suffering Paula to follow
her own inclination; but a keen perception
of the ludicrous was so thoroughly awakened that
the aunt could not restrain a hearty laugh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Truth was, Ruth Kinsolving was little more than
a girl, herself; a wholesome-natured if high-spirited
one, and, as mother Amy too well knew,
but ill-fitted to rule over a houseful of young
folks, like these whom Providence had brought
to her door. Doubtless, being blessed with
excellent sense, she would find a way for herself
out of the puzzle; and a way which would retain
her own self-respect while still commanding
theirs. But as yet she had not even thought
about this way, nor of anything but the immediate
needs of her great family.</p>

<p>Paula turned, in a fury; forgetting instantly
her determination to show these American relatives
what a great lady she was, and becoming
the actual reality,&mdash;a very quickly offended,
untrained girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see occasion for laughter in my
misfortune, Aunt Ruth; and I wish that Uncle
Fritz had never brought us here. You may as
well learn in the beginning that I never wished
to come and that I shall go away as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>A sharp retort formed itself in Ruth Kinsolving&#8217;s
mind, but rested there unspoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not laughing at thee, dear little Paula,
but at the absurdity of thy attempted dignity,
clad just as thee is. It is high time we were
both indoors, and thinking less about ourselves
and more about our neighbors. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth slipped her arm, covered only by
its cambric sleeve, about the waist of her niece,
and would have guided her affectionally back to
her chamber.</p>

<p>But Paula would not. She had been a trifle
touched by the soft tone in which this new aunt
had said &#8220;dear little Paula,&#8221; but she was slower
to forget resentment than to feel it. So she
hurried forward alone, and made her way to the
room where Christina was sleeping, in the refreshing
rest which follows a simple supper and
bedtime thoughts of sweet good-will.</p>

<p>Ruth went to Grandmother Capers, and found
the old lady greatly shaken by the shock she had
received. Surprising as it was, Margaret Capers
persistently refused to accept Ruth&#8217;s plain and
natural explanation of the affair, and reiterated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
her belief that she had really seen a spirit, whose
visitation was intended as a warning of direful
things to come.</p>

<p>From his room adjoining, Melville heard the
discussion and terminated it in his own fashion:
&#8220;Go to bed, grandma, and keep still! If, at your
age, you want to be a fool, be one, and not
bother other folks about it! As for you, Aunt
Ruth, I wish you would get me a drink of fresh
water out of the well, and take yourself off out of
the way. I hate this night rowing! If you don&#8217;t
get back to that side of the house pretty soon,
some of the rest of your imps will be breaking
loose! I&#8217;ll make grandmother get out of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee will, in a sense thee little understands,
ungrateful boy!&#8221; replied his long-suffering aunt,
after she had drawn and brought the water.
&#8220;And I will ask thy permission to give thee a
bedtime thought. If there are any &#8216;imps&#8217;
under this roof this night, they are locked up in
thy own selfish heart. If thee is really a Kinsolving,
see to it that thee treats that poor old
woman in yonder with common decency. One
of these nights thee will order her and she will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
not obey.&#8221; And with that for a good-night, the
much tried young house-mistress took herself off.</p>

<p>Melville was sufficiently nervous to find sleep
impossible for weary hours to come; and it is
probable that the self-indulgent lad had never
done a greater amount of thinking in a like space
of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ruth has a way of saying things which
cut; but they generally cut in the right place
when she says them to other people! Did she
mean it? Am I an &#8216;imp,&#8217; myself? I suppose
I don&#8217;t speak very respectfully to grandma,
sometimes; but she is such a silly thing that she
tries me awfully. And everybody knows I am
an incurable invalid. It&#8217;s a pity I can&#8217;t talk as
I please, when I am doomed to lie here like a
log! I&#8217;d be a saint if I had that little imp
Fritz&#8217;s legs and fists! How he did use them,
though! And I couldn&#8217;t but admire the young
monkey, in spite of my anger, he did so make
me think of one of Abraham&#8217;s bantam roosters.
Well, maybe some of the Pickels will be relishable;
and if they are, I&#8217;ll try not to scare them
away by crossness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>From which soliloquy of Melville&#8217;s it will be
seen that while the would-be reformers had all
gone to bed in the truly missionary spirit, the
sinner to be reconstructed was doing his own best
to make his stubborn clay pliable to their touch.
Also, that his threat of &#8220;getting out of this&#8221; was
a threat merely, and not to be taken seriously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fritz</span>, junior, slept soundly; but he had a child&#8217;s
fashion of waking early. When he found the
sunlight shining into his eyes through the window
which, being unaccustomed to care for young
folks, Aunt Ruth had forgotten to darken,&mdash;and
thus insure her own undisturbed morning nap,&mdash;he
sat up in bed and looked about him. He was
perfectly wide awake on the instant, and the
cheerfulness of the sunlight was scarcely greater
than the clear light of the lad&#8217;s own happy nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a dreadful bad boy, last night! I&#8217;m
awful sorry I licked the crippler and&mdash;by jingo!
I&#8217;ll go and tell him so!&#8221;</p>

<p>Paula had labored long and seriously with her
little brother; but he didn&#8217;t take polishing well
at all&mdash;that is, of the sort which his elder sister
was minded to give him. It made not the slightest
impression on this small man to be forbidden
a dozen times a day to use the language which
came naturally to his lips, and which from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
association with the boys of the street he had
come to consider smart.</p>

<p>More than this, Uncle Fritz was always inclined
to concur in Fritz, junior&#8217;s, own opinion.
But, for the matter of that, pretty nearly everything
the little lad did was &#8220;smart&#8221; in the eyes
of his adoring uncle, who firmly believed that his
namesake was an epitome of every human grace
and virtue. He would not have had the child
different for half his fortune; and it was well for
the little fellow that he had the wholesomest and
sweetest of natures, and that he had sprung from
a race of gentlefolk.</p>

<p>But there was a polishing he did take, readily.
If by any chance&mdash;alas! they were frequent&mdash;he
had inadvertently really pained any living
heart, he could not rest till he had done his
childish utmost to banish that pain. Once, on
one never-to-be-forgotten, dreadful day, he had
told Fritzy Nunky a lie! &#8220;Story&#8221; does not express
it; fib is too mild; falsehood or untruth
indicate a premeditation which was absent from
the offence; so, though it is an ugly word, never
to be carelessly uttered or written, it must stand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
No matter what the lie was about; that was
between the two Fritzes. Suffice it to tell that
the big Fritz had suffered actual agony, fearing
that his idol was going to be found wanting in
that first foundation of all nobility,&mdash;truthfulness.
And the little Fritz has seen the agony,
and&mdash;but the sorrow of a little child is sacred.</p>

<p>So that rough corner of his character was
polished till the shining gold showed bright and
sparkling. Fritz never told a second lie; nor
would he have done so for any enticement which
could have been offered him.</p>

<p>Now he remembered that he had been
&#8220;spunky&#8221; and almost &#8220;killed&#8221; somebody; and
somehow this tender-hearted little gentleman felt
as if his day would begin better if he could get
that unpleasant memory off his mind. So he
slipped out of bed, threw his nightshirt into one
corner of the room, soused the water in the bowl
all over the floor, in his vain effort to make it
answer for the tubbing to which he was accustomed,
tried to straighten his curly tangles of
hair with two strokes of the brush, then to button
his shoes on the wrong feet, and gave up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
matter as satisfactorily settled by leaving both
unfastened, put his knickerbockers on wrong side
before with a goodly protuberance of shirt waist
to protest against the arrangement, and hied
himself out of the room.</p>

<p>As he passed a little chamber under the stairs,
he heard the familiar snore of Fritz the elder,
and was about to run back and get a pillow to
hurl at him. It was a kind of awakening to
which both the Fritzes were accustomed, in their
loving equality of playfellows, but for once Fritz,
junior, refrained.</p>

<p>Not from the slightest hesitation about disturbing
his guardian, but because it would hinder
him from finding and apologizing to Melville.
He was in a great hurry to get that job off his
hands; then he would be free to hunt up that
donkey who lived with his pretty aunt, and ask
his permission to be ridden.</p>

<p>Melville was in a refreshing sleep. His feeble
body needed it as much as his tired brain, for
half of the invalid&#8217;s crossness came, had his
relatives but known it, from a restlessness of
mind which needed to be understood before it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
could be cured. There had never been any one
about him to understand it; so the crippled lad
had lain month in and month out weaving his
fancies to himself, and disdaining to confide
them to any other, as one shrinks from trusting
a perfectly and freshly ripened cluster of grapes
to the careless fingers of a child, lest its delicate
bloom be lost before its beauty becomes known.</p>

<p>Out of his dreamless rest he was awakened
by the touch of a little hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, you poor crippler, can&#8217;t you! I
want to tell you I&mdash; Say, can&#8217;t you wake up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz had stiffened the grasp of his fingers to
a painful clutch; and he had yet to learn that
Melville was habitually &#8220;sore all over,&#8221; outwardly
as well as within.</p>

<p>The clutch succeeded where the gentler touch
had failed, and the sick lad opened his eyes with
such suddenness that his disturber fairly jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dickens are you doing here again?&#8221;
roared Melville.</p>

<p>Fritz trembled. Still, he did not retreat; he
was far too much in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come&mdash;I come&mdash;&#8221; began the child, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
paused, confused. He somehow found this humiliation
of himself vastly harder than any of
the many similar confessions he had previously
made. He was accustomed to having his &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorrys&#8221; met more than half way by the friendly
interpretation of love.</p>

<p>But there was no love in the scowling brow
upon the pillow, and only a very present memory
of the indignity which its owner had suffered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see you&#8217;ve &#8216;come.&#8217; Why? That&#8217;s
what I want to know!&#8221; thundered the invalid.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Melville? Did you call me, darling?&#8221;
sleepily asked Grandmother Capers,
coming to the doorway; and Fritz&#8217;s ready attention
was drawn away from his cousin to her.</p>

<p>He looked; he stared; and as he stared his
eyes grew bigger and bigger, which was quite
unnecessary, since they were very round and
wide open at all times. He had never seen any
such person, and instantly he decided that the
old lady was the &#8220;Witch of Endor,&#8221; about whom
his guardian was continually talking when things
went wrong in his great business house. &#8220;The
&#8216;Witch of Endor&#8217; is to pay!&#8221; was Uncle Fritz&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
most vehement expression; and little Fritz
thought that this must be she, and he did not
at all wonder that big Fritz dreaded her.</p>

<p>His feet began to shake in their ill-adjusted
shoes, and, if his hair had not been so well
deluged by those two dabs of the brush and bath
water, it might have stood upright.</p>

<p>Melville saw the growing consternation on the
childish face before him, and turned from it to
its cause. Then he did not even attempt to
restrain the disrespectful laugh which followed.</p>

<p>Grandmother Capers was one of those saving
old ladies who do not wear their false teeth when
asleep; and as by daylight she wore both
&#8220;upper&#8221; and &#8220;under,&#8221; and as her features were
of the sort described as hooked, the economy
resulted in an undress, and sinister appearance,
which was at least an unlucky transformation.
Add to that the fact that she was also one of
the fast fading race who cling to a combination
of false-front and black silk skull-cap draped
with lace by day, in lieu of their own silver locks,
the effect when this regalia was laid aside added
one more factor to a get-up which Fritz did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
find attractive. Then, being of slender build and
sensitive temperament, she always found it convenient
to sleep wrapped in one shawl; and, owing
to the undue exposure of the night just gone,
she had put on a second, of rich color and great
amplitude. Below all trailed a heavy dressing-gown
which was summer and winter bedfellow
to shawl number one.</p>

<p>Melville was on the point of retorting to her
usual fond inquiry: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t &#8216;call you darling!&#8217;&#8221;
but one of those rare glimpses of humor
which proved him, after all, to be something of a
Kinsolving and relative to Ruth, averted the
sharp retort. For the first time in his life he saw
his doting grandmother as other people saw her;
or might see her, if they were admitted to the
close intimacy which was his.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness sake, grandmother! Haven&#8217;t
you what you call a &#8216;Bay State&#8217; shawl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And I suppose you think I ought to
have it on.&#8221; She laughed gaily, in relief from
the usual reprimand and appreciation of their
mutual wit.</p>

<p>But to the little foreigner the laugh was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
terrible than Melville&#8217;s frown had been. His
chin dropped, and something very like a quiver
swept over the brave red lips.</p>

<p>Melville&#8217;s gaze had returned to his cousin&#8217;s
face by then, and an impish impulse seized him.
He would make Fritz kiss Grandmother Capers!
The child evidently regarded her with some inexplicable
terror, and this would be a punishment
complete and well-deserved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here a minute, grandma.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loving creature obeyed the summons
swiftly, glad of his unusual gentleness, and in
her feeble haste stumbled continually upon her
long train. This gave her the hobbling gait which
was the one touch needed to make her, in Fritz&#8217;s
eyes, the so much dreaded &#8220;Endor woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to kiss this sweet little boy. He
is an early visitor, and so devoted, you see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville&#8217;s laugh, saying this, was harsh, but
that Mrs. Capers did not observe. She only
knew that Melville laughed. She was ready to
do anything he asked of her. So she followed
after the child, who slowly retreated, and bent
her face to touch his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Kiss me, little man. Come, kiss me good-morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kiss the &#8220;Witch of Endor!&#8221; It was dreadful
enough to know she really lived, and right here
in his own grandmother&#8217;s house; but&mdash;kiss her!
Before the horror of that rite the stalwart soul
of the &#8220;little man&#8221; appeared to die within him.
He tried to retreat still farther, and found himself
prevented by the barrier of a wall. He
darted his terrified glance this way and that for
some way of escape, but the pale morning light
showed nothing clearly. Else would the still
bright eyes of Grandmother Capers have seen
what they did not see, that the child&#8217;s hesitation
was not shyness but fear; and even for Melville&#8217;s
dear sake she would not have done what she did
do.</p>

<p>Fritz felt the frill of her night-cap brush his
hair, then her peppermint-scented breath reached
his nostrils, and, with a shriek as if all the witches
ever known to history were upon him, he struck
out in his own defence.</p>

<p>Melville, even, had looked for no such result
as this. At the most, he expected to see &#8220;a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
fun&#8221;; but his knowledge of healthy boyhood
was slight, and a boy who, small as this one was,
had yet pluck enough to protect himself from
the aggressions even of &#8220;witches&#8221; was amazing
to him.</p>

<p>Needless to say that poor Mrs. Capers was far
more astonished than her grandson, and with a
more serious cause. As the first blow of the
sturdy little fist fell on her unsuspecting cheek,
she started and staggered back. Then came a
second blow, and she retreated still farther; but
her aged feet caught in the folds of her long gown,
and she was thrown violently to the floor.</p>

<p>For a moment chaos reigned.</p>

<p>Fritzy&#8217;s fighting blood was up. &#8220;St. George
and the Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Ralph the Lion Killer&#8221;
were nothing to him. He, who all unarmed and
unsuspecting, had met and conquered Uncle
Fritz&#8217;s &#8220;Witch of Endor!&#8221; Wouldn&#8217;t Fritzy
Nunky be a proud and happy man when she
should be safely out of the way, and no longer
&#8220;to pay!&#8221; At this thought the whacking blows
redoubled, and it was only owing to Grandmother
Capers&#8217;s well wrapped person that she was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
then and there annihilated, as her adversary,
forsooth, intended.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Melville lay helpless on his bed
and hollaed. The game had gone to terrifying
limits, and he was powerless to stop it, save by
his lusty voice; which, for awhile, seemed rather
to egg on the small pugilist than to restrain him.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all concerned, Content was also
an early riser; and this one morning in especial
she had been &#8220;up with the lark,&#8221; that she might
help Aunt Ruth, rightly foreseeing that the sudden
invasion of a whole flock of hungry youngsters
would make breakfast-getting a task for
many hands.</p>

<p>As she entered the passage which ran by the
apartments devoted to the Caperses, the sound of
Melville&#8217;s voice reached her. She was used
already to hearing it pitched in the most disagreeable
of tones, but there was something in
these roars out of the common. She had heard
him quarrelling with his grandmother, and, after
intrusion on one such scene, had learned to take
herself as far away as possible before witnessing
another. Under all her gentleness, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
still enough of the old Kinsolving &#8220;substance&#8221;
left in Content&#8217;s veins to make her wholly sympathize
with Aunt Ruth&#8217;s views concerning Melville
Capers&#8217;s treatment of his grandmother.</p>

<p>She paused an instant; then, arrested by the
difference in the &#8220;roar,&#8221; the next she had
pushed open the door and come upon the conflict.
What it meant she could not guess; but
what it was she saw only too plainly. With one
bound she had caught up Fritz in her arms, and
was holding the struggling child from further
mischief.</p>

<p>But he was not minded to be so restrained.
&#8220;Let me go! Let me go, you great girl, you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Melville, stop calling, and tell me
what it means,&#8221; answered Content, heedless of
Fritz&#8217;s violent struggles but finding herself almost
incompetent to control them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must call. There must somebody
come. You can&#8217;t hold that infernal little beast
and help grandma too. Ruth&mdash;Aunt Ruth!
Grandmother! Somebody!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandmother Capers, feeling that she was no
longer being assaulted, ventured to raise her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me, darling. I&mdash;I&#8217;m not
hurt much, I&mdash;I think.&#8221; But the feebleness of
her tone denied her statement, and with a new
distress Content saw that the poor old lady&#8217;s nose
was bleeding.</p>

<p>The sight of the scarlet flow he had caused for
a moment incited Fritz to fresh struggles and
fresh exhibitions of prowess. Truly, it had been
reserved for the last of his race to be the fighter
amongst them! Another moment and he realized
that this was the sweet-faced new cousin
Content who was holding him, and that Aunt
Ruth had said of her that she &#8220;was very, very
lovely in her mind, as well as in her person.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weather-cock curiosity of childhood
veered on the instant. He ceased kicking, but
none too soon for the girlish strength he had
taxed so severely, and improved his chance to
scrutinize the features so near his own. Aunt
Ruth had told him about Content, during that
sleepy, undressing talk of the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that she is pretty in her
mind, too?&#8221; he had asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because her mind shows through her face,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Aunt Ruth had answered; and now he had an
excellent opportunity to see where. Not that he
supposed his cousin&#8217;s face would be really transparent,
but he believed it must be different from
that of others. The only difference he found,
however, was in the singular clearness and gentleness
of her expression.</p>

<p>Content saw that for some reason she had
gained his momentary attention, and she followed
up her advantage. &#8220;Go quickly, and call Aunt
Ruth. If you cannot find her bring somebody&mdash;the
first person you can see.&#8221; Then she sat him
down upon the floor, still wistfully regarding him
lest this strange combination of tenderness and
wrath, in the form of a boy, should develop some
new and more untoward quality as well.</p>

<p>But she need not have feared. Beside the
quiet command of her eye, his ear had caught
the words: &#8220;Are you badly hurt, poor grandma?&#8221;
uttered in a sympathetic voice by the
&#8220;roaring crippler,&#8221; and he was completely at
sea. So he walked slowly out of the room, but
less in obedience to her wish than because he was
puzzling to understand how this Melville, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
his own cousin and lived here in America, could
by any possibility be the grandson of the &#8220;Witch
of Endor,&#8221; who, he was perfectly sure, belonged
by good rights at his uncle&#8217;s great book shop in
Munich. So perplexed, indeed, was he by this
problem that he walked straight into the legs of
portly &#8220;Fritzy Nunky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, small sir! And so after waking up thy
poor guardian with thy noisy racing over the
stairs thou wouldst walk him down like a nine-pin!
Hey?&#8221; The jolly uncle swung his nephew
to his shoulder, and marched away through the
passage to the open door at its end.</p>

<p>When they came to the sunlight, he cried,
&#8220;And pray where was thy valet this morning?
Surely, there is something out of common with
this!&#8221; The great hand caught hold of the escaping
waist frill and tucked it into hiding.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Fritzy Nunky, I forgot. They want
you, the folks do. The roaring crippler, and the
lovely-minded girl, and the &#8216;Witch of Endor.&#8217;
I reckon I&#8217;ve about settled <i>her</i>, though! So
you won&#8217;t have her no more &#8216;to pay.&#8217; Ain&#8217;t
you awful glad?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>By many unfortunate experiences Uncle Fritz
had learned that he could not always rejoice
when called upon to do so by his small nephew,
and he promptly inquired, with some misgiving,
&#8220;What do you mean, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz, junior, recognized the change from the
tender &#8220;thou&#8221; to the sterner &#8220;you,&#8221; which with
his guardian &#8220;meant business,&#8221; and he answered,
instantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve pounded the old woman in there pretty
hard, I reckon; and the girl said for you to come
quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Fritzy! more mischief?&#8221; demanded the
uncle, reproachfully. Then he put the little boy
down and ordered him to lead the way.</p>

<p>So Mr. Fritz Pickel&#8217;s introduction to old lady
Capers was made under circumstances which
neither that devotee of conventionality nor the
courteous gentleman would have preferred. But
one glance of his keen eyes showed him that the
case was far too serious for any ceremony, and
the expression of them as they rested upon the
strangely attired and prostrate figure was one
that his little nephew never forgot.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very grave and tear-bedimmed little
lad who sat on his guardian&#8217;s knee. It had
been a gentle but earnest talk which had caused
the tears; and somehow the boy understood
well just what it was in his behavior which
had so troubled Fritzy Nunky&#8217;s heart, &#8220;down
deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble had not been just the same as that
one about the untruth; but it had come nearest
to that of any emotion the dear face had ever
shown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, don&#8217;t you, little man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I see,&#8221; Fritz made answer, between
those long, swelling sobs which are so distressing
to the child lover. &#8220;It&#8217;s this here way: I am
a good boy, and you know I am a good boy.
An&#8217; you want these new folks to know I ain&#8217;t a
reg&#8217;lar fighter, but I&#8217;m pretty good. But you
see, it don&#8217;t&mdash;it isn&#8217;t&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t,&mdash;well, I
couldn&#8217;t just help pitchin&#8217; into that Melville. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
didn&#8217;t do it for ugly, but I couldn&#8217;t &#8217;pear to help
it, nohow! I hope I don&#8217;t want to do it again;
but if I do, how&#8217;m I goin&#8217; to help it? It&#8217;s the
quickness inside of me that makes my fists go
double up. It isn&#8217;t&mdash;me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, then, art thou going to prove to these
kinsfolk that it isn&#8217;t &#8216;me?&#8217; I fear the dear
grandmother thinks it is the real &#8216;me&#8217;; and I am
sure the Aunt Ruth does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you make her understand diff&#8217;runt?
Couldn&#8217;t you tell her how good I am, Fritzy
Nunky?&#8221; asked the unhappy child, coaxingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure I will do that. But how am I to
make it seem real to her? Thou wilt have to
make her understand that&mdash;I cannot. Fritzy
Nunky does know about the good heart, and
the fair intentions; but if they do not show on
the outside, what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was too deep for little Fritz. He
waived it, asking another:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the &#8216;Witch of Endor?&#8217; I ain&#8217;t a-going
to fight her no more, you bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz smiled, but not very happily.
&#8220;She was a very wise old lady who lived in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
ancient times.&#8221; Then, thinking to disabuse the
lad&#8217;s mind of mistaken notions, he added: &#8220;She
must have been a kindly soul, too; for when the
King Saul,&mdash;a man who fought, and intended
to fight, so was not like my boy,&mdash;when this
fighting king came to her, though she was afraid
he would kill her, yet she made him a dinner of
her fatted calf and a wheaten cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calf? That&#8217;s veal, isn&#8217;t it? Suppose it
was a veal pot-pie, like Aunt Ruth had for
dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must ha&#8217; been good! And did the fighter
have her &#8216;to pay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Fritz laughed. Then he enlarged
upon the good qualities of the ancient dame
with &#8220;the familiar spirit,&#8221; hoping to arouse some
liking for her in his nephew&#8217;s breast, and craftily
leading the child on to understand that all these
excellent things were repeated and strengthened
in the present person of Mrs. Margaret Capers.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she was so good, why do you still have
her &#8216;to pay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am a foolish man. I use words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and expressions that I should not. I get vexed
when things go wrong, and then I feel I must say
something. That expression which has so misled
you came most natural; and now, indeed,
I do have &#8216;to pay&#8217; by seeing what a muddle I
have led you into.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was much more of this talk, during
which the guardian did not exempt himself from
a generous share of the blame. If he had &#8220;had
more wisdom&#8221; his charges would have made a
better showing on their first appearance at their
new home, and not have appeared so much like
a lot of &#8220;untrained savages.&#8221; Consequently,
their reception would have been more cordial.</p>

<p>For it must be confessed that the friendly Aunt
Ruth had not treated her younger nephew with
much consideration after his second pugilistic
exploit. She did not care to have history repeat
itself in that way. It was one thing when the
victim was that exasperating Melville, and quite
another when a frail old lady was the sufferer.
She had not said very much, and therein congratulated
herself for being unusually prudent; but,
as Fritz had expressed it, &#8220;she had looked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
her eyes&#8221; in a way that meant volumes, and &#8220;talking
eyes&#8221; had been the one thing he had ever
feared most. Uncle Fritz &#8220;talked eyes&#8221; when
he was the most deeply aggrieved; and little
Fritz found it most unpleasant to have an American
relative addicted to the same bad habit.</p>

<p>She came into the room just then and there,
and, seeing the two Fritzes in such confidential
discussion, would have speedily withdrawn, had
not the gentleman risen and begged her to remain.
It was as good a time as another to explain
how matters really were.</p>

<p>So Aunt Ruth sat down and listened patiently;
but with an unbelieving manner which hurt the
kindly German far more than she dreamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I doubt not they are excellent children,
as children go; but I have had little experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Pickel smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tone indicates that you have still had
all that you desire&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; thee must not say that, nor think it,&#8221;
interrupted the lady quickly. &#8220;They are my
sister&#8217;s children. It is right that I should be
bothered with them, as well as that thee should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
be. Thee has certainly had thy share of their
care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do not look at it in that light, dear
Fr&auml;ulein. It is not the care that I dislike; indeed,
that I never feel. It is that you and your mother
should misjudge my children, and not understand
how really good and delightful they are. Fritzy,
now&mdash;&#8221; Here Ruth intercepted a grateful
glance which the child raised to his uncle&#8217;s
face, and could not fail to be touched by it.
&#8220;Fritzy is a wonderfully obedient and honorable
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritzy&#8221; began to prick up his ears; but he
let them droop, so to speak, at sound of his aunt&#8217;s
expressive &#8220;Humph!&#8221; But he was very tired
of the whole subject, and longed to make an end
of it. It was already afternoon of that day
which had opened with such bright anticipations
of a new donkey friendship, and all he had been
able to accomplish in the way of it was to stand
sorrowfully in the doorway of the passage, where
Uncle Fritz had bidden him remain, and sigh in
sympathy with Don&#8217;s mournful bray. At that
very moment the echo of it came to their ears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and the boy left his uncle to walk to the window
and look out.</p>

<p>Young as he was, Fritzy still hated to make
promises, for he had already learned by observation
that it is a very difficult matter to keep them.
But he suddenly determined to run the risk of one,
thinking by that means to cut short this wearisome
talk and his own imprisonment, as well as
bring back the right kind of a smile to his pretty
aunt&#8217;s face. So he walked toward her, watching
her eyes intently, and was relieved to find them
&#8220;talking&#8221; no longer, or only in a gentle way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ruth, I won&#8217;t never fight anybody any
more. Truly, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a rash thing to say, Fritzy; how
about the &#8216;quickness inside of you?&#8217;&#8221; asked his
guardian, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;ll bother me like ginger;
but if I say I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t; will I, uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is to be trusted, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; testified
that witness.</p>

<p>Ruth stooped down and raised Fritzy to her
lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, little one; we are Friends&mdash;Quakers&mdash;in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
this household. Our yea is yea, and our
nay, nay. Thee is Quaker, too, on thy mother&#8217;s
side, and I am going to believe it is she who
speaks through thee. Now thee may kiss me
and go to Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he will not be tempted to break his
word,&#8221; commented Aunt Ruth, as the lad disappeared
like a flash through the open doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be tempted, but he will not break
it,&#8221; answered Uncle Fritz, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee speaks strongly, and he is&mdash;such a
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he is&mdash;<i>such</i> a child, dear Fr&auml;ulein.
They are all dear and delightful, but little Fritz,&mdash;he
is my one &#8216;sweet pickle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling at this very evident truth, Aunt Ruth,
with a greatly relieved heart, followed &#8220;little
Fritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">What</span> is it, Paula?&#8221; demanded Octave.
&#8220;You look as if you had been taking a dose of
castor oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hateful boy!&#8221; said Paula.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Melville Capers. He&#8217;s as horrid
as&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a boy. You can&#8217;t compare him to anything
worse,&#8221; laughed the younger girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;All boys cannot be like him, or grown-up
folks wouldn&#8217;t endure them. They&#8217;d imprison
them somewhere till they learned decency. I
shall have nothing more to do with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Paula! Lose all the honor of reconstructing
him? You, the head of the family?
What did he do or say? What are you mad
at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad. It is an unladylike word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! You&#8217;re as mad as a March hare, or
a hornet, or a bear with a so&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Octave Pickel! I should think you would
be ashamed of yourself! A young lady fourteen
years old using such coarse expressions!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A young lady sixteen years old giving occasion
to me to use them! Paula Pickel, I should
think you would be ashamed of yourself! You
would if you knew how you were looking at this
very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? What?&#8221; asked the elder girl, anxiously,
rising and crossing to the tiny mirror.
&#8220;I do wish Aunt Ruth would let us have something
bigger than this to use! It&#8217;s so small that
I cannot see more than half of my head at one
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I do,&#8221; laughed Octave; &#8220;dress yourself
before the wardrobe door.&#8221; And suiting the
action to the word, the merry girl placed herself
in front of the door in question and gravely began
to brush and freshen her long, tangled hair.</p>

<p>She had finished and had put on a clean gown,
ready for the supper table, for which her healthy
appetite was also ready, long before Paula had
ceased twisting and turning about before the little
glass to see what was amiss with herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything, Octave. What was it
that was wrong?&#8221; she cried, as her sister went
dancing and singing out of the room. &#8220;Stop,
and do tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d say, &#8216;Octave, Octave!&#8217; in that reproachful
tone of yours; and how should I ever
bear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&mdash;I know it; I realize it. Seriously,
sweetheart, there was nothing wrong with your
appearance, only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only what? Do tell me. I don&#8217;t want to go
down stairs looking like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like your careless sister Octave! It&#8217;s only
what Fritzy says about Content: the &#8216;lovely mind
showing through her face&#8217;; so it was with you,
heart&#8217;s dearest!&#8221;</p>

<p>And laughing at the renewed disgust in her
victim&#8217;s countenance, Octave ran away. She
could no more forbear teasing somebody than she
could doing the hundred and one other useless
things which were the result of her overflowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
life. Paula was dear, really; but Paula was such
fun! And poor Paula herself was just sufficiently
conscious of her own shortcomings to make her
doubly sensitive to others&#8217; raillery.</p>

<p>Only those shortcomings did not lie in the
direction she supposed; and they did lie just in
the road Octave had suggested. Paula bewailed
her occasional lack of dignity, her lapses from
correctness of speech, her ignorance of style,
and any other slight flaw in a character she was
really accustomed to think a bit above par.</p>

<p>Full of herself, and full of plans, she had gone
that afternoon to sit with her cousin Melville.
The family project for improving that disagreeable
invalid had been held in abeyance by the
condition of poor Mrs. Capers, who, for a fortnight,
had been drooping and under the doctor&#8217;s
care, while her charge was almost wholly neglected
by that good man.</p>

<p>The fright her ghastly face and fainting condition
had given Mr. Pickel, after his nephew had
&#8220;paid her&#8221; for her supposed resemblance to the
&#8220;Witch of Endor,&#8221; had abated as the day wore
on, and her injuries had appeared not to be serious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
And, afterward, she had seemed not really
ill, but simply not as usual.</p>

<p>In the secret of her own heart she believed
that she had &#8220;got her warning&#8221;; and when, one
day, the physician had ordered her to go to bed
&#8220;for a bit,&#8221; she had felt that she was obeying
him forever.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, yet perhaps not really so oddly
after all, the old lady had taken a fancy that of all
the household little Christina should attend her
few wants. Paula she would not see on any pretext,
and Octave she found too noisy. Content
had taken her own place at Melville&#8217;s bed-side,
and this was how she would have had it, since
Content would bear in silence what the others
would resent in anger.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth was busy, always, with the needs
of such a family, and gentle Amy Kinsolving&#8217;s
strength would allow of her doing no more than
go from room to room of the well-filled Snuggery,
&#8220;carrying sunshine&#8221; and words of good-cheer.</p>

<p>But this day there seemed to be a lull in the
rush of affairs, and Paula thought that she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
do two benevolent things at once. Unfortunately,
few, however skilful, do &#8220;kill two birds with one
stone&#8221;; and Paula was most unskilled. Her
missionary spirit was of the warlike kind; and,
as she would have said to a tropical heathen,
&#8220;You must read your Bible and wear these
clothes,&#8221; so she started in to reform Melville by
feeling that it rested with her to <i>make</i> him do
what she considered fitting.</p>

<p>Now, nobody, big or little, on this earth likes
to be what Fritz called &#8220;musted.&#8221; Even Content
felt a disinclination to leave her post at the
cripple&#8217;s side, since they had found that in their
mutual love of Dickens and his magic they could
meet on happy ground. The girl&#8217;s musical voice
was just picturing, with a pathos her sympathy
made real, the death-scene of little Paul Dombey,
and both reader and listener were steeped
in sorrow for the loss of one who was a real personage
to them, when the door opened and Paula,
crisp and rattling in her freshly starched skirts,
entered.</p>

<p>To sensitive Melville, the effect was as if she
had struck him; while Content felt as deep if a
quieter disappointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to sit with you, Melville; and
Content, you are to go right out and have a game
of tennis. Aunt Ruth says this moping indoors
isn&#8217;t good for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tennis! Alone? And I&#8217;m not moping at
all. We were having a real good time; weren&#8217;t
we, Melville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were; but it&#8217;s over!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed; it isn&#8217;t over. If Aunt Ruth
wished me to go out of doors, I am sure it
was because she thought I must be tired. But
I&#8217;m not tired; I&#8217;d rather read Dickens than play
tennis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Content Kinsolving! Here you have
been held up to us as a shining example, and you
are, after all, what even little Fritz would disdain
to be,&mdash;disobedient!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paula! Did Aunt Ruth really say I was to
go out?&#8221; asked Content, with her color rising.</p>

<p>Now, Ruth had said nothing of the kind. What
she had remarked was that she wished Content
cared more for such healthful games as this&mdash;to
her&mdash;new one of lawn tennis, which had been
introduced at The Snuggery along with the pony-cart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the archery outfit, the photographic camera,
and the various other amusements which that
most indulgent man, &#8220;Fritzy Nunky,&#8221; provided
for his charges.</p>

<p>However, Paula felt herself warranted in interpreting
the spirit of her aunt&#8217;s words in a fashion
to suit herself. She was bent on missionizing;
and she silenced any misgivings of her own conscience
by the conclusion that the end justified
the means. Though her face flushed with guilty
shame at the lie she was acting, she did not distinctly
answer; but the air of injured innocence
with which she took her place by the foot of
Melville&#8217;s lounge said more than speech;&mdash;she,
Paula, was not accustomed to have her word
doubted; if Content was suspicious enough to
mistrust her, why she was above resentment; as
for her, she always did her duty, whether other
people did or not. All this was conveyed to
quick-witted Content by the simple manner in
which Paula spread out her dress, tossed her fair
head, and quietly took her seat.</p>

<p>Poor Content was far from being an example,
or even a &#8220;lovely-minded girl,&#8221; at that moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
She did not remember to have ever been so angry
in her life. And yet, since there had been no
word uttered, there could be nothing to contest.
For once she felt that she would enjoy a good
squabble&mdash;it would have been such a relief to
her feelings. But one glance into Melville&#8217;s
darkening eyes and frowning brow convinced her
that she could safely leave the matter in his
hands; and it was with a satisfaction which
proved her to be most humanly erring that the
girl laid down her book and went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deliver me from a saint!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; sweetly asked Paula. Having carried
her point she was in a most complacent mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said,&mdash;Deliver me from a saint! That&#8217;s
you! Do you hear? Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear; but I do not mind it. You are
so ill that you are scarcely responsible for what
you say. I mean&#8221;&mdash;for she suddenly recollected
that she was about to lecture her cousin
on his wretched lack of self-control, and was
contradicting herself beforehand&mdash;&#8220;I mean, that
although you are hard to get along with, I at least
have sympathy with you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;Hang your sympathy!&#8221; retorted its ungrateful
recipient.</p>

<p>Paula paid no heed. &#8220;Shall I go on reading
where Content left off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; thundered this lad of the mighty voice.
&#8220;It would be sacrilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Paula, forgetting
for an instant the r&ocirc;le of angel she had intended
to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that it isn&#8217;t such a prig as you who
can understand Dickens!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prig is a word to apply to boys, Cousin Melville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To girls, also, when they make nuisances of
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paula bit her lip; but she conquered her temper
by holding up to mental view the wonderful
good she was determined to accomplish even by
means of the falsehood she had acted. It would
be so delightful, when she had converted Melville
from the error of his ways by sheer force of her
own perfection, to hear her friends say, &#8220;That is
all dear Paula&#8217;s work. Melville was a thoroughly
disagreeable boy when Paula took him in hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
We owe so much to Paula.&#8221; And almost hearing
these laudatory phrases, so keenly did she imagine
them, she turned again toward her victim with
the question, &#8220;If you are tired of Dickens, what
would you have me read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. If you read as you talk, it would
be unendurable to me. Why do you clip off the
ends of your words in such a fashion? This isn&#8217;t
a &#8216;woom,&#8217; and that isn&#8217;t a &#8216;wockin&#8217;-chai-ah!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, if there was anything about herself of
which Paula was more proud than another, it was
her sweet and well-trained voice. Her modulation
was exquisite, and it really pleased Melville;
but because he saw that it was a weak point with
his cousin he selected it as an object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Paula waited till she had counted ten twice
over, before she ventured to speak. Then she
ignored Melville&#8217;s attack and asked, &#8220;What would
you like me to do, then, if you do not wish me
to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melville Capers, you are no gentleman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no saint, so you needn&#8217;t pose for
one!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;I do not pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do. You came in here with that sanctimonious
look on your face,&mdash;though a lie in your
heart,&mdash;as if you thought yourself a little better
than all the world, and were fully determined that
all the world should know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sneer which cuts deepest is the sneer which
has a bit of truth in it.</p>

<p>Poor Paula eyes filled. She did not find the
work of missionizing so much to her taste as she
had fancied, and it is certain that she could not
have selected a more difficult subject to try her
hand upon.</p>

<p>Melville was shrewd and clever. Paula was
clever, but not at all shrewd. The boy did not
know, of course, about the family project of his
reconstruction, but he was quick to scent out
Paula&#8217;s motive for preaching to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he said testily; &#8220;we might as well
make an end of this business before it is begun.
I am shut in here, and cannot do much for myself;
but what I can do I will&mdash;you bet! And
one of these things is that I can say who shall
and who shall not inflict their society upon me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
These rooms belong to my grandmother and me
as much as the rest of the house does to Grandmother
Kinsolving. There is one class on which
I shall always have the door shut,&mdash;the class of
saints. It is unfortunate that you should belong to
it; but, since you do, the deduction is obvious.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Paula had had any doubt as to his meaning,
it was removed by the very significant glance her
cousin cast upon the door. With burning cheeks,
and feeling as if she would never again try any
missionary work, she rose and walked away. As
she reached the door, Melville called after her:
&#8220;If you see Content, or even the little fighter,
send them in. It&#8217;s horrid lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply, and as her footsteps died
away Melville judged, and rightly, that his message
would not be delivered. Paula went straight to
her room, and to her teasing sister Octave, to go
through the familiar trial of the younger girl&#8217;s
gibing tongue just when she was most ill-fitted to
endure it.</p>

<p>It was an hour after Octave had left her, and
after poor Paula had relieved her anger by a fit
of weeping, that she smoothed her ruffled feathers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
once more and went below stairs. She expected
a word of reproof from her punctual Aunt Ruth
for her late appearance at table, but to her surprise
the supper-room was unoccupied. The meal
had evidently been going on, and had been interrupted
by some unusual occurrence; for the plates
showed half-eaten food, napkins had fallen in uncommon
places, and the disarranged chairs proved
that the family had left the apartment in haste.</p>

<p>Paula walked to the door and looked out. There
was not a person in sight; neither was there anything
but the absence of human life to give her
occasion for anxiety; yet a feeling of uneasiness
stole over her, which, had she been as nervous as
Mrs. Capers, she would have called a &#8220;presentiment&#8221;
of some mischance.</p>

<p>After a moment of searching the lawn for any
sign of the family, she fancied that she could detect
the outlines of a group of people in a distant
field, which was almost hidden from the house by
a thick grove; she raised her clear voice and
shouted, &#8220;Octave! Christina! Uncle Fritz!&#8221;</p>

<p>But only the echo of her own cries came back
to her from the surrounding hill-tops.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Divided</span> between curiosity and hunger, Paula
stood for some seconds deliberating whether she
should go to join the group of people in the distant
field or eat her supper. She finally decided
upon a compromise, and, carefully spreading a
delicate slice of bread, she made a sandwich of it
by adding a bit of boiled ham, and thus fortified
for any emergency she left the house.</p>

<p>She walked rapidly, at the same time casting
furtive glances about lest somebody should see
her &#8220;unladylike&#8221; performance of taking her
supper &#8220;on the fly,&#8221; as was the habit of harum-scarum
Octave. But no one observed her, or
would have been at all shocked had they done so;
and when the sandwich was finished the girl
quickened her steps to a run, and reached her
family in a breathless state unusual with her.</p>

<p>It was a scene of confusion upon which she
came so hurriedly; but her first exclamation was
one of relief: &#8220;Oh, it is only Octave!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;Only Octave!&#8221; spoke volumes. It showed
how familiar the elder sister had become with
that unlucky maiden&#8217;s misfortunes; which were,
indeed, even one degree more frequent than those
of little Fritz, and he appeared&mdash;according to
his Aunt Ruth&#8217;s fancy&mdash;to exist merely for the
sake of tumbling out of one scrape into another.
That Octave had not before this displayed her
aptitude for disaster was due to the fact that
provocation for such was rare at the peaceful
Snuggery.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Only Octave!&#8217; but she has about done for
herself, this time,&#8221; replied Uncle Fritz. He sat
on the ground, holding his niece in his arms, looking
very anxious but very red and heated as well.
He was too stout to make the swift run he did
without suffering for it, and Paula stooped down
and offered to take his place in supporting the
girl who lay so still and white before them all.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of her anxiety Aunt Ruth
noticed Paula&#8217;s action, and was more pleased by
it than she was accustomed to be by that &#8220;young
lady&#8217;s&#8221; ways. It showed a consideration and
sisterliness which, in her first hasty estimate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
&#8220;Miss Pickel&#8217;s&#8221; character, the aunt had believed
to be entirely wanting.</p>

<p>Grandmother Kinsolving stood at a little distance
from the group, resting against Content,
while Christina and Fritzy hugged each other in
a terror of some great grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it all about?&#8221; asked Paula, anxiously,
bending to see if Octave was not beginning to
breathe again, and even then shrinking a trifle
from the streams of water with which Uncle Fritz,
with a liberal impartiality, was deluging his unconscious
niece and all who surrounded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon it was this here way,&#8221; replied the
farmer, Abraham Tewksbury, who managed the
farm for the Kinsolvings; &#8220;I was a-lettin&#8217; the team
stand whilst I run back ter shet the bars. This
&#8217;ere was the last load I was a-goin&#8217; ter tackle ter-night,
an&#8217; the boys hed gone on ter the barn ter
commence milkin&#8217;. I &#8217;lowed to &#8217;em &#8217;t I could git
the load in alone; an&#8217; so I could, ef&mdash;&#8221; Here
the narrator cast a glance, half angry, half sorry,
at the victim of her own good-will. &#8220;But Octavy,
here, she come a-tearin&#8217; out the house an&#8217; down
here, like she was possessed. &#8216;Lemme drive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
horses, Abry-ham,&#8217; sez she. I told her she&#8217;d a-better
not; &#8217;cause one on &#8217;em was kinder coltish,
an&#8217; not used ter strange drivers. But she&#8217;d got
her head sot, an&#8217; whilst I was gone ter the bars
up she clumb onter the hay-riggin&#8217; an&#8217; grabbed
the reins. Fust I knowed, I heered her holler, an&#8217;
then she give a sort of Injun warwhoop; an&#8217; then
she snatched a whistle out her pocket an&#8217; begun
ter blow it. I yelled to her ter stop. That off
mare she was scairt once at a band, an&#8217; she hain&#8217;t
never fergot it; but Octavy, she uther didn&#8217;t
hear me, er less she warn&#8217;t afraid, for she kep&#8217;
right on a-blowin&#8217;. Next I knowed, thar she was
an&#8217; the hull load o&#8217; hay a-top of her, an&#8217; the horses
broke loose an&#8217; runnin&#8217; like Jehuwhittaker!&#8221;</p>

<p>Abraham paused for want of breath, and all
eyes were gladdened by the signs of returning
consciousness which poor Octave showed. She
had been stunned and almost smothered by her
fall, and the hay which fell with her. It had been
Abraham Tewksbury&#8217;s lusty yells which had
roused the family from their supper talk, and then
they had all flown to the scene of the accident.
By the time they reached it the farmer had caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and unhitched the team, and leaving them to find
their own way stableward had vigorously set to
work to toss the hay from off the girl, and to see
if she were yet alive. That she should escape
with her life, after being dragged half the length
of the great meadow, seemed to him little short
of a miracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose it was the hay&#8217;t saved her. No, I
don&#8217;t nuther. It was Providence. Nothin&#8217; else
on the face o&#8217; the airth!&#8221; he had ejaculated fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee is right, Abraham. The Providence who
watches over all His children,&#8221; said Grandmother
Kinsolving, quietly. Even in that supreme moment
of anxiety which her pallor showed her to
be suffering, the outward serenity of Mother
Amy&#8217;s face remained sweet and undisturbed, and
Ruth wondered if anything could ever find her
distrustful or afraid.</p>

<p>At a motion from Ruth&#8217;s hand, Uncle Fritz
ceased racing to and fro between the brookside
and the fainting Octave, and waited while she
opened her eyes and looked wearily about her.
Then he darted off for a horse and disappeared
in search of the doctor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>When she could talk, Octave assured her anxious
friends that she was &#8220;not hurt but scared&#8221;;
but when she attempted to raise herself on her
elbow she sank back with a groan, and the slowly
returning color vanished anew from her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye think it would hurt ye very bad ef I
should carry ye ter the house, Octavy?&#8221; asked
Abraham, kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate&mdash;to move,&#8221; answered the poor girl,
faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis, I don&#8217;t doubt it, not in the least; but ye
know ye carn&#8217;t lay there all night, an&#8217; I guess my
carryin&#8217; on ye won&#8217;t hurt ye so much as &#8217;twould
ter be took some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others agreed with Mr. Tewksbury, and
after one more protest from the injured girl, he
lifted her in his strong arms and set out carefully
for the house. The family followed slowly, Aunt
Ruth&#8217;s face worn and terrified, as she saw that the
motion, gentle as it was, made her niece sink into
another faint. She tried to recall something of
the peacefulness of her life before these &#8220;pickles&#8221;
came into it; and Melville&#8217;s ill-temper and selfishness
appeared almost angelic by contrast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>It was just a month since that fateful telegram
had exploded in their midst, and already it seemed
to the young mistress like a lifetime. A month&mdash;and
Fritz, senior, had had the care of these children
for years! How had he ever managed and
yet retain his jollity? He not only endured them,
but he seemed actually wretched at the thought
of his long journey into South America, which
would take him away from them for a few weeks.
Then the thought recurred of his advice about
Melville: &#8220;Just love him.&#8221; Ah! it must be this
&#8220;just loving&#8221; that made all the difference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would love them, too; I should be glad to&mdash;if
they would only keep still long enough!&#8221;
ejaculated the perplexed woman.</p>

<p>Fritzy heard her, and was glad to have the
silence broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say, Aunt Ruthy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said&mdash; O Fritzy! Is something always
happening to thee or thy sisters? Is there no
such thing as quiet any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child looked gravely into the troubled face
above him. &#8220;Why, yes, Auntie; I am quiet,
ain&#8217;t I? They ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; &#8216;happened&#8217; to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
this whole, endurin&#8217; day. Now, Octave, she&#8217;s
settled; an&#8217; Paula, she don&#8217;t never do anything
not ezactly proper, so Fritzy Nunky says. Christina
doesn&#8217;t do anything bad at all. I reckon
it&#8217;ll be all right, Aunt Ruthy, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth smiled. Yet he comforted her also, for
there was such a world of affection in his big blue
eyes, as he lifted them to her troubled face, that
her heart warmed to him. After all, though they
were so vexatious, these &#8220;mixed pickles&#8221; left by
her dead sister for some one to care for, did, as
Uncle Fritz had predicted, &#8220;season&#8221; her life with
a new interest. She would not exactly like to
part with them just yet.</p>

<p>But her thoughts were interrupted by their
arrival at the house, and the preparations for
getting Octave made comfortable in her own bed-chamber.</p>

<p>Then the doctor came and examined the suffering
girl, and reported, as a result of her prank,
a broken arm and a badly sprained ankle. &#8220;And
it is well she has escaped, even at that cost; she
could not take a similar risk again and come out
of it alive,&#8221; added the physician gravely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Uncle Fritz was to have gone away on the
morrow, but this accident deferred his departure;
and over that the whole household rejoiced so
heartily as almost to lose sight of the cause of
the delay.</p>

<p>Octave herself helped them to forget. The
same exuberance of life that carried her into one
scrape after another, served to sustain her under
any trial. A night&#8217;s rest set her nerves all
straight, and her healthy body suffered less than
another&#8217;s might have done. So long as she
obeyed orders and lay perfectly still, she was comparatively
free from pain, and she had not been
crippled for a day before she began making plans
for her own comfort and that of every one else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you see, Aunt Ruth, that there is no
use in having this pretty room of yours all in a
muddle, as it is sure to be if I stay in it; besides,
grandma doesn&#8217;t get her nap as she ought to do
with me so close to her room, and all the &#8216;pickles&#8217;
running in and out, as they do. Just you have my
cot rolled into Melville&#8217;s sitting-room, and I&#8217;ll stay
there days. Nights I can sleep in that funny little
hall outside of it, which I think is the prettiest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
place in the whole house. Then, you see, the one
who takes care of Melville, or hears him grumble,
will have to hear me too,&mdash;lump it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee doesn&#8217;t know Melville as well as I do,
dear Octave, or thee would never propose such
an arrangement as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that for you, Aunt
Ruth, but for him! If you all treated his royal
highness to a little more &#8216;pooh!&#8217; and a little less
&#8216;please!&#8217; he&#8217;d be a more self-respecting boy.
Try it, anyhow, won&#8217;t you? I can&#8217;t hurt him
very much, now I&#8217;ve got myself tied down to this
bed of roses. Try it, and I&#8217;ll lose my guess if I
don&#8217;t do him good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. Octave&#8217;s cheeriness surprised
and greatly pleased her. Not even illness seemed
to affect the merry girl&#8217;s spirit, and she was quite
inclined to accept her proposition. The more so
as Grandmother Kinsolving was the idol of her
daughter&#8217;s heart, and Octave had hit the nail very
squarely on the head in saying that the old lady&#8217;s
rest would of necessity be greatly lessened by
having Ruth&#8217;s adjoining room occupied &#8220;as a
hospital.&#8221; Mother Amy was frail at the best;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and, before these Pickels came, her health had
been the one anxiety and care of the young housekeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee is a thoughtful child, Octave. I am half-minded
to give thy notion a trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>The injured girl&#8217;s face brightened still more.
&#8220;I did not know that you ever had a &#8216;half-mind,&#8217;
Aunt Ruthy. You look always decided enough
to have a great, big, sound, and whole one, with a
few &#8216;pieces&#8217; to spare. Well, let&#8217;s get &#8216;Abry-ham&#8217;
and I&#8217;ll &#8216;beard the lion,&#8217; and all the rest
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will hope that &#8216;all the rest of it&#8217; will not
prove too much for even thy daring soul,&#8221; replied
Aunt Ruth gaily; and as she passed out of
the room she paused to give her charge a quiet
kiss. This demonstration was rare with the aunt,
and little Fritz alone of all his family would not
have found it so. Because it was so unusual it
was all the more appreciated by its recipient, and
Octave banished the last regret she had felt; for,
gay as she was, and little as she acknowledged it,
there was an unselfishness in her proposal which
even Aunt Ruth did not suspect. It was seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that Octave appeared to think of herself; but no
one had ever observed that this was from any
principle. It had rather seemed that the child
never had time. She was always flying from one
project to another, gay as a bird, and apparently
as thoughtless. She certainly was the last one of
all the young people whom her aunt, or any other,
would have selected as likely to do the peculiar
Melville any good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Abry-ham&#8221; came promptly, glad to be of
use. His fatherly heart had been touched by the
heroism with which Octave bore the setting of
her broken bones and injured muscles; and even
before that he had been won by the frank friendliness
of the &#8220;young lady,&#8221; who was said to be a
very rich person as far as money went.</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing that the uncultured mind
so greatly regards as money; and the airs which
Paula manifested were accepted as natural and
appertaining to her station in life. If he had
thought about the matter at all, Abraham would
have considered that he should have done the
same as Paula did under similar circumstances;
but, even so, he found Octave&#8217;s simpler ways and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
equality of manner preferable. He would never
stand in awe of her as he did of her elder sister,
but he would do what was far better,&mdash;he would
love her.</p>

<p>There was pleasure in his honest eyes because
he had been summoned to do this service for the
injured girl, and the ring of affection in his voice
as he entered with his cheery, &#8220;Jehuwhittaker!
This is how ye make things spin, is it? Don&#8217;t
make no more o&#8217; breakin&#8217; a bone er two &#8217;an some
folks does o&#8217; prickin&#8217; their finger! Wal, I hope
ye&#8217;ve counted the cost, afore ye set sail ter keep
house along o&#8217; Melville. He&#8217;s a critter &#8217;at likes
his own paddock, an&#8217; no interference, I tell ye.
Ye&#8217;re brave enough ter tackle a team o&#8217; wild
hosses, but ye better think twict afore ye tackle
Melville Capers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare think twice, Mr. Abraham; I&#8217;m
going right quick, while my first courage lasts.
Now don&#8217;t you or Aunt Ruth say another word,
but just wheel ahead! I&#8217;ll shut my teeth hard
and not groan once, if you do hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the well-oiled castors of the little bed ran
smoothly, and the wide doorways and corridors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
seemed especially made for moving beds about,
so Octave fancied; and in a few minutes the
passage to Melville&#8217;s sitting-room was made, his
door opened, and Octave&#8217;s narrow couch pushed
in.</p>

<p>The cripple was so astonished that he almost
sat upright. &#8220;What in thunder!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon!&#8221; said Octave, merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are not very civil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave made a significant gesture, and both her
smiling, anxious attendants withdrew to an invisible
distance, leaving the two bed-ridden cousins
to stare one another down.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that silent contest of wills Octave came
out conqueror. There was no resisting her
merry audacity, with its underlying principle to
strengthen it, and Melville was the first to speak.
He did so in his own peculiar fashion, and his
cousin answered after hers.</p>

<p>To her surprise, he did not make himself half
so disagreeable as she had expected. It may be
that he, too, felt drawn to the high-spirited girl
whose whole life was such a contrast to his own;
or it may be that his heart was softened by the
reports from the apartment of his grandmother,
whom he had really loved in his own selfish fashion,
even though he had tormented her in so
unmanly a manner. Then, too, there was sound
common-sense at the bottom of his nature, and
he could but see that it was an impossibility for
even energetic Aunt Ruth to look after three invalids
in as many separate places.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Grandmother Amy thrown in for good
measure,&#8221; concluded Octave, quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Twenty-four hours proved the experiment a
success, and another twenty-four made Melville
wonder how he had ever managed without this
new companion, though she did scarcely one
thing he desired her to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been coddled and babied till you
aren&#8217;t half a boy, Melville Capers; and a good
thing it is for you that your grandmother is sick
and I have come to take her place. Not a bit of
coddling you&#8217;ll get from me, so you needn&#8217;t look
for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>If he fretted, she laughed. If he read sentimental
or melancholy poems, as he was given to
doing, she repeated Mother Goose. If he praised
Dickens, she lauded Scott. If he complained of
his cruel portion in life, she ridiculed him and
told him it was his own fault.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded, after this
last seemingly heartless assertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I heard Aunt Ruth say that, if you had
not been so afraid of trying heroic treatment
when you were little, you might have been cured.
Even when you first came here, and that is only
three years ago. But you cried, and &#8216;couldn&#8217;t,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and your poor grandmother loved you so she
&#8216;wouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; and so you have no one to blame for
a wasted life but your own cowardly self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave Pickel! You are rightly named.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so. My family is an honorable one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are Pickel by name and the sourest
kind of a pickle by nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharp, not sour. That is, none too sour. It
doesn&#8217;t do to have everything sweet&mdash;like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate you! I want you to go out of this
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. The doctor forbids me to walk, or
even try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville fixed his eyes upon her face in a long,
questioning gaze. Then he gave a great sigh&mdash;which
was almost a sob. Octave&#8217;s own look did
not falter, and out of the depths of her warm,
wholesome heart she echoed the sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and how&mdash;how do you like it?&#8221; Melville&#8217;s
question came bitterly, fiercely.</p>

<p>Octave&#8217;s merry eyes filled with a sympathy that
the boy could not fail to see was wholly genuine.
&#8220;Cousin Melville, I do not like it at all. I can
hardly bear it, even for these few days or weeks I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
shall have to endure it; and I cannot bear that
you should submit to it so tamely. You must
not&mdash;you shall not!&#8221; cried the girl, excitedly.</p>

<p>She understood perfectly, with the electric perception
of youth, that the cripple had compared
her temporary helplessness with his own, which
he supposed incurable. She had been longing to
have just this subject come up between them, for
down in her heart she had hidden a daring
thought.</p>

<p>The thought had been caused by a talk with
her Uncle Fritz; which, however, that soft-hearted
man had little intention should bear just such
fruit.</p>

<p>He had said that he believed the boy could be
helped, or that he could have been, by a difficult
and painful operation which a celebrated surgeon
of his own country, now inspecting the American
hospitals, had once successfully performed.</p>

<p>The thought had come like a flash to Octave
then and there; and, with a minuteness which her
fond uncle thought an admirable thirst for knowledge
pure and simple, she had questioned him
of the operation in all its details. Now, Mr. Fritz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Pickel always protested that a famous surgeon
had been lost to the world when his father had
apprenticed him to business; and it was his
recreation, still, to &#8220;walk the hospitals&#8221; with his
many friends among the doctors, and he would
grow most enthusiastic over any difficult or particularly
&#8220;beautiful&#8221; case which they reported to
him or allowed him to see.</p>

<p>So he fell innocently into Octave&#8217;s little trap,
and the girl was now fortified with all the information
she required. The opportunity she craved
had come, and, though she trembled a little, she
improved it.</p>

<p>Melville had naturally asked, &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that, according to my Uncle Fritz, you
are not what you think,&mdash;incurable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best physicians in the country have said
I am!&#8221; cried the lad, mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a better than the best, and he is &#8216;in
the land&#8217; now, if you will see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who sent you in here to distress me like
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My love for you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Your love! A pretty way you take of showing
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is the best way, Cousin Melville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is cruel to raise false hopes like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Are you any worse off for hearing
about this great surgeon? If you are so indifferent
to yourself that you will not endure a
little suffering to be made well, you are certainly
too small-minded to be very greatly hurt; and if
you are willing, isn&#8217;t it love for you that has
prompted me to find out all about it, and tell you?
I thought I&#8217;d sound you first, yourself, because it
all rests with you. Then, if you had any sense, I
would get Uncle Fritz, who is as wise as the
wisest where surgery is concerned, to tell you
everything he knows. He doesn&#8217;t know that I
am going to talk with you, nor anybody; and no
one need know if you do not choose differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave, if I were never so willing, Grandmother
Capers would never allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Melville; I know that. But&mdash;why hide it?
You know, you must know, what the others all
think, that dear old Mrs. Capers is just slowly
and gently dying. She cannot live very long to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
wait upon you, even if she gets up from this
strange sickness which nobody understands exactly,
and I should think you would like to change
places and do a few things for her, who has done
so many for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Octave had been sorely troubled by Mrs.
Capers&#8217;s illness. All the household had reassured
her again and again that she was mistaken, but
she could not help fancying that her little
brother&#8217;s encounter with &#8220;the Witch of Endor&#8221;
had something to do with his victim&#8217;s fading
away. And, since she could do nothing for her
personally, she longed beyond telling to help the
grandson who was more to the doting old heart
than its own life. After she ceased speaking the
cousins lay each very quiet for a long time.
Octave was frightened by her own temerity, now
that the deed had really been done; and in Melville&#8217;s
breast hope and despair surged up and
down tumultuously.</p>

<p>So occupied, indeed, were they with their own
thoughts that they did not perceive the entrance
of a frail little figure of a woman, which glided
softly in its old familiar way to the foot of Melville&#8217;s
lounge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;What is that, my darling, about your being
cured?&#8221; said a pathetically feeble voice, so suddenly
that both the hearers started violently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Capers had seated herself on the lounge,
but so weakly and tremblingly that the others
expected to see her fall. Octave half slipped
from her low bed, forgetting her own injury in her
eagerness to support the tottering old lady; but
she was arrested as much by the words which followed
as by the exquisite torture of her injured
ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melville, I have heard the whole talk. I&mdash;I
am going to die&mdash;as this young girl says. I am
not sorry, except for you; and now I am not
sorry at all. I could not bear to see you suffer
any more, or to endure&mdash;an operation,&mdash;even
though it might cure you. I love&mdash;I love you
too well. But, when I am gone, I want you to
try it, if&mdash;if you have the courage. There will
be money enough, plenty of money to pay anything
this great doctor asks. Promise me, darling;
that is, if&mdash;you don&#8217;t mind, if you wish
to, that you&mdash;will see this surgeon. I shall die
happy then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The sick woman&#8217;s long speech, and her eagerness
to utter it, exhausted her. Appalled by the
unexpected effect of their own words, the children
gazed at her in helpless silence. But suddenly,
upon the wan features turned so anxiously
toward Melville, there came a change which even
his inexperienced eye was swift to interpret.</p>

<p>With a strength born of excitement,&mdash;or given
by God,&mdash;he forced his useless body downward
upon the lounge until he could clasp and hold his
grandmother&#8217;s head against his breast.</p>

<p>Then a rapture, born of her great love for him
and of her gratitude for his unwonted tenderness,
illumined the aged face: &#8220;My darling&mdash;my
darling!&#8221; she cried faintly. And, as if over-weighted
by happiness, the white lids closed above
the faded eyes which had looked for so little in
this world.</p>

<p>For a long time the stillness remained unbroken.
Then a groan burst from the lips of the lad who
had held a great love lightly&mdash;till it was lost.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, that is what she needs; it is the only
thing.&#8221; The doctor said this very firmly and
gravely; but quiet as his words were they set the
impetuous heart of Ruth Kinsolving in a fever of
anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure thee is hiding something from me,
Doctor Winslow; and I wish thee to tell me the
worst. If my mother is&mdash;is going to follow
Margaret Capers, I&mdash;I must know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not going to follow her, if you do as I
say. Take Mrs. Kinsolving away at once to the
sea-shore, or to some restful place, where she can
have a complete change of air, and as little disturbance
of her habits, otherwise, as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth looked up searchingly; but seeing
nothing in the familiar face of their old physician
to warrant her dreadful fear, her thoughts turned
at once to a lesser trouble. It was all very well
for Doctor Winslow to say, &#8220;Go away to the sea-shore,&#8221;
but how was this apparently simple matter
to be accomplished?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>The death of Mrs. Capers left the invalid Melville
entirely dependent upon his aunt&#8217;s care.
His grief had been profound and prostrating; for
that sorrow is always keenest which has self-reproach
as a factor; and though a fortnight had
elapsed since the quiet funeral, its influence still
hung, pall-like, over the house.</p>

<p>Octave was better; but she could not yet put
her injured foot to the floor without great suffering;
although the broken arm was mending fast,
and gave the self-helpful girl little trouble. It
was astonishing how much she could accomplish
with that deft left hand of hers; and she laughingly
declared she had been gifted with her power
to use it as others use their right, expressly for
this time of need.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickel had been obliged to leave them, or
lose entirely the business opportunities which had
brought him all the way from Germany, and which
he was ambitious to improve &#8220;on his children&#8217;s
account.&#8221; It was all for the children&mdash;his care,
his life, his love; and Ruth Kinsolving could not
live for so many days in the society of this unselfish
man without catching something of his spirit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
From an unwelcome burden, she had also come
to regard her sister Lydia&#8217;s family as a sacred
charge; and, as each girl of the group resolved
herself into a distinct individuality, the aunt&#8217;s
interest increased. She grew almost morbidly
anxious lest she should fail in her &#8220;duty&#8221; to one
or other of the orphans.</p>

<p>How, then, was she to leave them with only a
servant to look after them?</p>

<p>Perplexed and troubled, she returned after the
doctor&#8217;s visit to her mother&#8217;s room, and one keen
glance into the tired eyes of the sweet old lady
settled the matter for her. Her mother was more
to her than all the orphans in the world. Her
mother was drooping sadly, overcome, the doctor
thought, by a burden of care she should not have
assumed, and shocked and broken by the death
of her old friend, Margaret Capers.</p>

<p>It seemed that turmoil and confusion had come
to The Snuggery only with the coming of the
Pickels. Well, she would leave them the house,
and they might tear it roof from rafter, for all she
cared at that moment; she would do her duty by
her mother, let come what would come!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Her energetic movement aroused Grandmother
Kinsolving&#8217;s curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth intended to be very prudent and announce
her plan in the least startling manner, but she was
far too impulsive and too much in earnest to do
this successfully. She tried, beginning two or
three sentences in a temporizing fashion, and
ending with an outburst of tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor says that thee is ill, so ill that I
must take thee to the sea-shore. Tell me, darling
mother, that it is not so very, very bad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy Kinsolving smiled. To Ruth there was
nothing so beautiful as her mother&#8217;s smile, and
that it still was left to cheer her went far toward
calming her anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor is right, Ruth. I am a little worn
and tired by this upsetting of our quiet life; but
a few weeks away from it will give me strength to
face the winter without being an added burden to
thy weary shoulders. Thee needs the rest as
much as I do. Thee takes things too much in
earnest, and frets thyself over imaginary shortcomings.
We will go away and leave the &#8216;little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
pickles&#8217; to look after themselves, under Rosetta
Perkins&#8217;s direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since her mother took the proposition so
quietly, and answered so cheerfully, Ruth&#8217;s
anxiety flew round to another side of the subject.
&#8220;Rosetta Perkins! A pretty woman she is to
have the care of such a houseful of young people!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is an excellent cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Amy! What has that to do with
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than thee thinks. Thee worries over
the children&#8217;s minds and morals, and that is well
enough in a way, but if their bodies are healthy
and sound, they may be safely trusted to do
pretty nearly right. They come of good stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth was speechless with amused surprise.
Such words seemed like heresy on the lips of the
saintly Amy; but they had the effect of checking
her own anxiety and of assuring her that her
mother was not so dangerously ill as she had
feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we can trust Content to keep things
straight, under Rosetta,&#8221; said Ruth, so merrily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
that her mother&#8217;s heart lightened. If Ruth had
been worrying about her, she had also been
worrying about Ruth; and, when matters reach
this stage between two people, it is time that
somebody else stepped in and set them at ease.
Good Doctor Winslow had done so by his pleasant
prescription; and, already, in less than five
minutes after he had given it, its beneficent effects
were evident. The sea-shore trip had become a
matter-of-course; what was the house to worry
about, more than a house? And as for the children,
how could they go far astray in that peaceful
abode?</p>

<p>&#8220;Content shall have her share of the task; but
Paula is the elder. Paula must be prime minister,&#8221;
said Grandmother Kinsolving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paula, mother? Paula is no more fit to be
set over the others than&mdash;than I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will make a vast difference to the girl
whether she is put in authority or whether she
assumes it. Paula will do right; thee may depend
upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Amy, thee is either a very foolish or
a very wise woman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Daughter Ruth, I have lived long. The years
should teach me something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thee is not afraid to put that maid of
airs and graces to rule in thy stead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one whit afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I wash my hands of the responsibility!&#8221;
said Ruth, half-laughingly, half-seriously,
and tossing those same shapely hands upward in
a deprecating fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do that really, my daughter; &#8216;cease carrying
coals to Newcastle,&#8217; and thee will find life a better
thing. Thee is a good &#8216;Martha,&#8217; but thee remembers
about &#8216;Mary?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee is the &#8216;Mary&#8217; of this household, sweet
mother. Thee has always had &#8216;the better part.&#8217;
I will try to learn of thee.&#8221; As she said this,
the daughter stooped and kissed her mother&#8217;s
cheek; then she went swiftly out of the room, intent
upon setting things in readiness for her contemplated
absence.</p>

<p>Ruth Kinsolving found always her best antidote
for anxiety in activity; and so promptly did she
settle all the details of the household management
during Paula&#8217;s and Rosetta&#8217;s reign, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
was ready on the next morning to start with her
mother for that vacation of rest they both needed.</p>

<p>The group of young folks who watched their
carriage out of sight felt for a few moments a
sense of desolation which even Paula&#8217;s pride in
authority, or Content&#8217;s serenity, could not banish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I feel&mdash;I feel so lumpy, and kind
of sick inside,&#8221; said little Fritz, dropping his head
on Christina&#8217;s shoulder; &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what makes
folks go away all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go into Melville&#8217;s room and be
miserable together,&#8221; said Content, trying to
smile, yet finding the tears interfering; &#8220;I think
I heard Octave say that Melville had had a letter
from your Uncle Fritz.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the little Pickels, that was a name &#8220;to conjure
by&#8221;; and with a quick change of sentiment,
they rushed pell-mell into &#8220;the lion&#8217;s den.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I tell</span> you, you must do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was considerable &#8220;substance&#8221; in each
voice. Melville, however, had the advantage of
years and his terrible &#8220;roar,&#8221; which, even accustomed
as he had become to it, Fritzy never heard
without a little tremor.</p>

<p>The child stood at a safe distance from the invalid&#8217;s
lounge, and held in his hands a worn
and scraggy old cat. &#8220;I say she is my very own,
&#8217;cause I found her. She ain&#8217;t yours, nor she ain&#8217;t
grandma&#8217;s. They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t nobody touch a bit of
her. She&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the interests of science, Fritzy,&#8221; said Melville,
changing his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care nothin&#8217; about the int&#8217;rusts of
science; my cat is my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy her of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to sell her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty cents will get an awful lot of taffy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any shops on Deer Hill.&#8221; The
change in tone told that Fritz&#8217;s obstinacy was
weakening. He looked down speculatively at the
disreputable-appearing animal in his arms. She
was a cat of many battles, and many &#8220;droppings.&#8221;
By this last method do the soft-hearted country-folk
pass on to their neighbors the nuisance which
has become intolerable to themselves. There are
tramp cats as well as human beings; and if the
&#8220;Marm Puss,&#8221; which was losing her breath under
her captor&#8217;s tight squeeze, could have told the
tale of her life, it would have harrowed the soul
of the boy so that even &#8220;taffy&#8221; would have been
powerless to tempt him. &#8220;Marm Puss&#8221; had
tumbled out of a bag at The Snuggery gate that
very morning, brought thither by a boarding-house
mistress from whom grimalkin had stolen
various bits of food.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good place,&#8221; said the boarding-mistress,
furtively watching the cat scamper barnwards
after her liberation. &#8220;These folks are
Quakers, and they keep cows.&#8221; Then she had
hurried away, lest her unneighborly action should
be discovered, and thinking herself very kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
because she had not killed the animal outright
instead of &#8220;dropping&#8221; it. She little dreamed for
what a fate she had reserved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an unhappy old thing. It would rather
die than live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but then, I am a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t! You&#8217;re a boy, same&#8217;s I am, only
bigger. If it was your cat, would you sell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for a quarter; and I&#8217;ve offered you fifty
cents. I&#8217;ll make it seventy-five if you will chloroform
her for me, and help me with the whole
business. But you couldn&#8217;t; you&#8217;d have to blab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, neither. I never blabbed in my
life. I never told nothin&#8217; when I said I wouldn&#8217;t.
Ask Fritzy Nunky, when he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fritzy Nunky&#8217; would like to have you do
this for me; he&#8217;s scientific himself. He would
have been a great surgeon; haven&#8217;t you heard
him say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that to do with this old cat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t grab her &#8217;thout I say so? an&#8217; you
won&#8217;t hit me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Not a grab, not a hit,&#8221; replied Melville, impressively.
He was ostentatiously taking out of
a purse three shining quarter-dollars. Then he
turned them over and over so that their alluring
glitter fell squarely upon little Fritz&#8217;s sight. He
was not in the least a mercenary child. Quarter-dollars
for their own sake might have been spread
before him in piles, and he would not have coveted
them. But quarter-dollars for &#8220;taffy&#8217;s&#8221; sake&mdash;Ah!
that was another matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you was a-going to buy it, where would you
go?&#8221; he asked, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Mrs. Duncan&#8217;s thread-and-needle store, in
the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I know better,&#8221; retorted the victim of
temptation; &#8220;you go to candy shops for candy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; this isn&#8217;t a city like Munich, or New
York, where you staid that week before you came
here with your Uncle Fritz. Up here in the
country they keep everything in one shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every what thing?&#8221; The questioner&#8217;s tone
was still doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, just&mdash;everything. I can&#8217;t make it any
plainer. &#8216;Abry-ham&#8217; buys his shoes there, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
his wife her dresses. Grandmother gets her milk-pans
there, and there is a candy counter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know? You ain&#8217;t never been
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Content has; she told me, and I&#8217;ve heard it
in dozens of ways. I know it, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritzy considered Content a responsible person,
if there was one anywhere. Her testimony
seemed conclusive, but he had not yet exhausted
the subject. &#8220;Do they keep fish-hooks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fish-hooks, and rods, and&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you, and had seventy-five cents to
spend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; answered the younger cousin, fixing
his eyes anew on the quarter-dollars, and roughly
estimating how many fish-hooks and how much
&#8220;taffy&#8221; they represented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d harness my pony to the cart, and I&#8217;d
drive down the mountain like split. But, first,
I&#8217;d help my poor cousin to learn all about
anatomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a &#8216;natomy?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a boy but a living interrogation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
point! Come! I&#8217;m not going to argue all day.
If you want the seventy-five cents, and the taffy,
and the fish-hooks, and any other thing you
happen to see, why, now&#8217;s your chance. If you
don&#8217;t, all right. I can hire Luke Tewksbury to
help me. He&#8217;d do it for a quarter, and throw in
a kitten to bind the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz&#8217;s own truthfulness made him accept this
statement literally. The silver in his cousin&#8217;s
hand assumed larger proportions; and the sudden
remembrance of how long it was since he
had really tasted taffy overcame his last scruple.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; he said, heroically, yielding the
now drowsy object of barter to his cousin&#8217;s grasp.
A slight misgiving as he did so died when he
saw how contentedly the creature curled herself
down upon Melville&#8217;s luxurious cushions.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks as if she liked you, a&#8217;ready,&#8221; said
the little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she does. She is a self-denying
animal, who is glad to die for science&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz did wish that Melville would not use that
unpleasant word &#8220;die&#8221; so frequently. Whenever
he heard it he didn&#8217;t like to look at &#8220;Marm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Puss.&#8221; Seeing this, the elder boy hastened
matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to that closet there. Open the door, and,
on the right-hand corner of the lowest shelf, you
will see a big bottle with a glass stopper. A
blue bottle.&mdash;Find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring it, then; and hurry up. First, go and
lock both doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, youngster, you quit that &#8216;what for&#8217;
business. I haven&#8217;t time to answer any more
questions, and now you have sold yourself to me
you can&#8217;t go back on your word. All you&#8217;ve
got to do is to obey. I&#8217;ll take all the responsibility.
You lock those doors, so that the meddling
girls can&#8217;t come in. Girls always want to
poke their noses into boys&#8217; business, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>It gratified Fritzy to think that he was &#8220;boys,&#8221;
having been accustomed to consider himself just
&#8220;little Fritz.&#8221; He went obediently to the two
doors, and fastened each. Then the windows;
for Melville was determined to make sure of no
interruption.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>When that was settled satisfactorily, he took
off the pretty cover of a big down pillow, and
drew it cautiously over the unsuspecting cat&#8217;s
head. Tired with many wanderings, she did not
in the slightest resist; especially as Melville&#8217;s
touch was soft and caressing, deluding not only
the four-footed victim but the little traitor who
had sold her unto death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Fritz, you go to that other closet beside
the chimney. Take out some of the books that
are on the floor, and fix the latch so it works all
right. Can you shut it tight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tight as a drum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the bottle in there, and get the cork all
ready to take out, but don&#8217;t you take it out yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done that. What next?&#8221; Fritz was
too genuine a boy not to have entered into the
spirit of this dark transaction by that time. His
blue eyes were big with importance; his cheeks
glowed; he whistled softly to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next is&mdash;the job itself. Now, you must
understand clearly. If you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;ll be a
fizzle. I&#8217;m half sorry I didn&#8217;t get somebody
bigger to help me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The tone and the words put Fritz on his mettle.
&#8220;I&#8217;m big enough to kill a old cat, I reckon!
If I ain&#8217;t, I should like to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, it won&#8217;t hurt her. So, if she
struggles, don&#8217;t you back out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Fritz, stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, take the animal and fire ahead.
When you get her into the closet, pull the
stopper out of the bottle, open the bag and pour
it in, and shut the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>It all appeared very simple to the elder boy;
and even so in a less degree to his small assistant.
But they had counted upon the non-resistance
of the victim.</p>

<p>Now, it seemed as if she had heard their
plotting, for all at once she sprung from the
cushion-cover which served as her prison, and
flew to the farthest corner of the big room. For
an instant the two lads gazed after her in surprise
that one who simulated submission so thoroughly
should develop such a gift for self-preservation.
Another instant, and Melville&#8217;s &#8220;roar&#8221; arose
upon the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You horrid little imp! After all the money I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
gave you, to let her go like that! I&#8217;d be
ashamed to call myself a boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t let her go, she let herself go. But
I&#8217;ll catch her again, see if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t! And I wanted to dissect her!
Your Uncle Fritz says there is no reason why I
shouldn&#8217;t be a great doctor, even if his famous
surgeon doesn&#8217;t cure me. And how am I going
to learn if I can&#8217;t trust anybody to help me! I
say it&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; cried Melville.</p>

<p>The excitement of the chase, added to all this,
acted upon the blood of little Fritz like flame
upon gunpowder. His voice took on a tone
which silenced the elder cousin&#8217;s complaints, and
hushed him to watchfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shut up a minute, so&#8217;s not to scare her
so, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll catch her again. I will, true as you
live!&#8221;</p>

<p>Round and round the room, over chairs and
tables darted poor &#8220;Marm Puss,&#8221; and Fritz
behind her. He was almost as lithe as she, and
even more determined. Twice they bounded
across Melville&#8217;s lounge, but by then he had
become himself so excited over the game that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
merely ducked his head aside, and said not a
word.</p>

<p>The chase ended with the victory in Fritz&#8217;s
hands. The strength of the ancient animal was
no match for his, and her spirit had long ago
been broken. It had flamed up anew for a brief
instant, but had died ignominiously, and she had
not enough &#8220;fight&#8221; left in her to use her claws
when she was finally captured and thrust, head
foremost, into the bag.</p>

<p>Into the closet Fritz rushed; and banged the
pillow-cover with his victim on the floor.
Grimalkin&#8217;s spirit might have been dead, but her
voice was not. It was her voice which had been
the cause of much of her unhappiness in life, and
was destined to be her final undoing. She
miauled so lustily that she angered her little
captor, and made him unmindful of his cousin&#8217;s
loud remonstrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out of the closet, Fritz! Come out of
the closet!&#8221;</p>

<p>No notice was taken of the appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you little simpleton! You must come
out of the closet! I didn&#8217;t tell you to go in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
shut the door behind you! Don&#8217;t open the
bottle till you have come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vigorous thumping of the bag and its
contents upon the floor told that the tragic end
had not yet been achieved, and the miauling
continued so long that Melville did not observe
when it at last grew less violent; though his
entreaties to his little cousin were unceasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Fritzy, dear little Fritz! Come out of
it quick! All the doors and windows are shut
and I cannot help you! Fritz&mdash;Fritz!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville paused to listen and to breathe; but
the sounds had all ceased behind that fast shut
door, and the sickening odor which stole through
the crevices told him that his cries had come too
late.</p>

<p>A moment later, and his own consciousness
seemed to leave him, as the terrible significance
of his own work came full upon him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Fritz had not heard the appeals which the
frantic Melville made to him, they had reached
other ears, and summoned the help which the
crippled lad was so impotent to render.</p>

<p>Rosetta Perkins, &#8220;mistress of the interior,&#8221; as
Octave called her when Aunt Ruth had reported
her mother&#8217;s decision concerning the household
heads, during the sea-shore sojourn,&mdash;Rosetta
Perkins had come to Melville&#8217;s quarter of the
house for the express purpose of hearing his
capricious desires concerning his supper.</p>

<p>Rosetta was conscientious in the discharge of
her duties, and had already done more cooking
than would have sufficed a family twice as large,
in her fear lest these young charges of hers
should not get enough to eat. Eat! How they
did eat! All except Melville; and because he
did not, the good Rosetta was worried and full of
self-blame.</p>

<p>But, for the first time, his fitful appetite proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
a blessing, since it brought upon the scene, in
their extremity of need, a person to rescue the
two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the land sakes! What on airth is Melville
a-hollerin&#8217; so fer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosetta quickened her footsteps, but as the
cries died for a moment, loitered for an instant
to set straight a misplaced chair, and tidy the
furniture which showed the careless fingers of
youth.</p>

<p>The cries, that were almost shrieks in their
intensity of terror, recommenced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that ain&#8217;t spunk! That&#8217;s something
worse &#8217;an that! What can have happened to
him!&#8221; Mrs. Perkins flew to the door, wondering
to find it closed, and rebounding, as she threw
her force against it, from its unyielding surface.
She tried the latch, and found the bolt had been
slipped. The cries ceased again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-comin&#8217;, Melville. I&#8217;ll run around to
the other door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only to meet with fresh disappointment; and,
in her wonder and distress, Mrs. Perkins began to
shake the door vigorously. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t there nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in there with ye? How did ye get locked in?
Never mind; I&#8217;ll get it open somehow. I warrant
it&#8217;s some o&#8217; them childern&#8217;s pranks,&#8221; she added,
under her breath. Then she tried the latch
anew.</p>

<p>She began to be seriously alarmed. She ran
to the hall window, and saw Luke mowing the
lawn. After repeated efforts, she made her voice
audible above that of the noisy little machine so
close to his ear. He looked up and saw her
frantic motions even before he heard her
summons.</p>

<p>Luke had a soul above lawn-mowers, and
always on the alert for excitement. He was at
the hall window in a trice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the house as quick as ye kin,
Luke! Melville&#8217;s doors is both locked fast, an&#8217;
he&#8217;s been a-hollerin&#8217; like all possessed. Now
he&#8217;s stopped; but say&mdash;don&#8217;t you smell nothin&#8217;
kinder queer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Luke sniffed, and made up such a horrid face
in doing so that Christina, who had appeared
behind Mrs. Perkins, laughed. &#8220;What is the
matter, Rosetta? Octave made me come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
see. She says somebody has been holloaing this
ever so long, but I thought it was somebody out
in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then ain&#8217;t you ner Octavy in Melville&#8217;s
room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no! Abraham carried Octave out to
the hammock after dinner, and I have been with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Content? An&#8217; Pauly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone to the post-office in the pony-cart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Fritzy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; answered poor
Christina, her gentle face growing very pale and
terrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s sunthin&#8217; turrible to pay!
Smash that door open, Luke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smash the door? I dassent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smash it, I tell ye! I&#8217;ll bear the blame, if
there is any!&#8221;</p>

<p>Luke tried an ineffective blow, and Mrs. Perkins
grew more excited. &#8220;Luke Tewksbury!
Smash it! That there smell&#8217;s chloroform! I
know it; I kin almost taste it! I hain&#8217;t handled
the stuff as many times as I have, a-rubbin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Melville&#8217;s poor body, &#8217;ithout lamin&#8217; the smell.
Sunthin&#8217;s happened to the bottle on it, an&#8217;
one, mebbe both, o&#8217; them boys is shet up
behind thet door! <i>Now</i>&mdash;will ye smash it?&#8221;</p>

<p>A terrific blow of his mighty fist was Luke&#8217;s
effective answer, and the panel gave way.</p>

<p>With a swiftness and coolness one would
scarcely have looked for in Rosetta Perkins&#8217;s case,
since Ruth had called her a &#8220;good woman without
any head-piece,&#8221; the housekeeper thrust her
hand through the break in the wood, and unfastened
the bolt. Every movement she made
told in effect, as she almost flew across the apartment,
dashed open the windows, drew the bolt
and opened the bedroom door, and caught up a
pitcher of water to throw it upon Melville&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The air was nauseous with fumes of the drug,
but it was less that which had overcome the
invalid than horror at his own deed, and its
awful result. With the thought that little Fritz
had been the victim of his would-be scientific
experiment, his weak nerves had given way; but
his last conscious thought had been: &#8220;Cripple
or not, I must save him!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>It seemed that the power of this determination
was already bringing him out of his swoon, for
the water had scarcely reached his face before
he opened his eyes. Instantly they filled with
terror. &#8220;The closet! The closet! Open the
closet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;which closet?&#8221; asked Rosetta, trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it&mdash;open it, quick! Maybe he isn&#8217;t
dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Perkins&#8217;s sight swam. The reality seemed
worse than she had feared. But Christina had
heard and understood the appeal, and flew to the
inner door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other&mdash;the other!&#8221; directed Melville&#8217;s
agonized voice.</p>

<p>Luke was beforehand with her, and even his
strong physique was for an instant overcome by
the pungency of the odor which filled his nostrils.
He staggered for a step or two, and then,
as the little girl was darting forward, he put her
gently aside and stooped down to lift the small
figure, which the light now made visible, from its
resting-place upon the closet floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>There was one brief word of command: &#8220;The
doctor&#8221;; and Luke had flown to obey it. Then,
forgetting utterly for that terrible moment the
suffering boy upon the lounge, the housekeeper
bore her inert burden straight out of doors, and
to the old well in the garden.</p>

<p>She could not have done better; but she was
still working and chafing the rounded little limbs,
which had before seemed all too active, and praying
over her task with the devout fervor of her
warm, believing heart, when Luke reappeared
with the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how glad I am! I didn&#8217;t dream you
would get here so quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just driving down the road. And well
that I was,&#8221; added the physician gravely.</p>

<p>It was three hours after that when he went
away, even then promising to return again before
midnight; but, when he did leave The Snuggery
for a brief time, it was with the hopeful assurance
that &#8220;if nothing unforeseen occurred,&#8221; the little
fellow would be none the worse for his dangerous
experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a world of joy or pain hangs on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
little &#8216;if!&#8217;&#8221; exclaimed poor Paula, between her
sobs.</p>

<p>For once, Content&#8217;s ready word of comfort
failed her; and she could not utter that &#8220;it is all
for the best,&#8221; which seemed such a truism in the
presence of this anxiety. She could see no
&#8220;best&#8221; which might be extracted from that
afternoon&#8217;s misfortune; and she could only fold
her sympathetic arms about the cousin whom, till
now, she had thought so cold of heart, and let
her tears mingle with Paula&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It was the wisest and kindest thing she could
have done. Paula had nourished a mistaken
notion that her &#8220;perfect Cousin Content&#8221; considered
herself infinitely superior to the worldly
and frivolous &#8220;Miss Pickel,&#8221; whose main interests
in life appeared to be dress and the supervision
of her neighbors&#8217; manners.</p>

<p>The truth was simply that each girl was
to the other a new and uncomprehended type.
Octave had early nicknamed the one &#8220;Beauty,&#8221;
the other &#8220;Duty&#8221;; and, unlike as they were,
it took just such a sorrow to break away the
outer form of habit and training, and show the
warm, friendly hearts beneath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The lonely, only child, Content, had become
very fond of little Fritz, and the genuineness of
her feeling touched the sister who watched so
anxiously beside him. A half-hour of this common
grief did more to make them know and love
each other than had all their previous weeks of
daily intercourse.</p>

<p>But the &#8220;best&#8221; was still in it all, even if hidden
from sight just then; and it was destined to work
a blessed change not only in that household but
in many another, to which its after effects should
reach.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some days after this affair, the &#8220;pickles&#8221;
remained quietly in their &#8220;jar,&#8221; as Octave
laughingly called the great house, wherein they
were all gathered at nightfall, no matter how
widely they scattered themselves by day.</p>

<p>Content had a fine camera, and considerable
skill in using it; so that on all possible occasions
she was away over the mountains, taking &#8220;views&#8221;
of this or that place, which her father had
described to her as being dear to him in his
boyhood. Bulky letters were regularly sent to
Osaka, and in each there was some new glimpse
of familiar scenes, which the missionary welcomed
eagerly.</p>

<p>But this delightful occupation, as well as
Paula&#8217;s &#8220;art&#8221; work, Christina&#8217;s lessons, and
Melville&#8217;s &#8220;experiments,&#8221; were discontinued
while the child who was the &#8220;life of the house&#8221;
remained drooping, and showing any effects of
his accident.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Octave had nearly recovered the use of her
nimble feet, and had, long before the doctor
advised it, begun to use the broken arm. The
one thing which was impossible to the active girl
was quiet; and one morning she announced to
the physician that her arm was &#8220;mended better
than the original,&#8221; and that she was going to
&#8220;help Melville do up some beetles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christina was at that very hour assisting
Rosetta to &#8220;do up&#8221; gooseberries; and the
difference in the choice of occupations showed
perfectly the difference in the sisters.</p>

<p>Doctor Winslow smiled. He had congratulated
himself upon having kept his uneasy charge
still as long as he had; and, indeed, he would
have found this far more difficult had not the
condition of Fritz engrossed all their thoughts.
However, that very morning the little fellow had
come down to breakfast with the rest, and insisted
upon it that &#8220;Paula should stop making believe
he was sick when he wasn&#8217;t no such thing, so
there; and he was going out to have a tussle with
Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t hurt him a mite,&#8221; remarked Rosetta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
when Christina had reported Fritzy&#8217;s daring
proposal to her. &#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t ben nothin&#8217; the
matter with him, anyhow, &#8217;cept his losin&#8217; his
senses. I&#8217;ve ben a thinkin&#8217; this couple o&#8217; days
&#8217;at ye&#8217;d all make the child sick with your cossetin&#8217;
him an&#8217; feedin&#8217; him trash. Let him try
the donkey; he won&#8217;t get fur, ner overheat
hisself a-ridin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Fritz marched boldly up to the aged burro,
and essayed to saddle him. All offers of aid in
this matter had been haughtily rejected, and
nothing could so easily have convinced them all
that their darling was quite himself again as his
amusing little swagger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Must think I&#8217;m nobody! Here I
have been a-drivin&#8217; that mare of mine away
down the mountain, and back; an&#8217; you folks
think I can&#8217;t saddle a silly old donk! Pooh! I&#8217;ll
show you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The show that he did afford them was certainly
a funny one, though not of the kind the little lad
himself intended.</p>

<p>From his lonely room, Melville heard the fun,
and distinctly recognized the voice of his small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
cousin. The sound of it in happy activity again
was sweet to his ears, for he had never ceased to
regret his unintentional injury of the child.
Octave had noticed this change more than any
of the others, and wondered at first what &#8220;had
come over Melville to be so like other folks&#8221;;
and, being of a nature opposed to secrecy, had
promptly asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I tell you, Octave; I had a big scare.
What if&mdash;no matter, he&#8217;s all right again, you
say; and one thing I mean to do: I mean to
think more about other people and less about
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had said this shamefacedly, as if he did
not feel sure of himself, but did feel sure of her
ridicule.</p>

<p>It came swiftly on the heels of his confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all nonsense, Melville Capers. &#8216;You
are no saint, and you needn&#8217;t pose for one.&#8217; You
have worried everybody about you ever since
you were born, and you will go on worrying
somebody to the end. I don&#8217;t take any stock in
your talk. You&#8217;re a little scared over what
you&#8217;ve done; but soon as Fritzy is all right
again you&#8217;ll be just as disagreeable as ever.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a hateful girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! I told you so! Don&#8217;t, for goodness&#8217;
sake,&mdash;yes, for goodness&#8217; real sake,&mdash;don&#8217;t ever
tell anybody that you mean to be &#8216;unselfish.&#8217;
He or she won&#8217;t believe you, to begin with; and
if they suspect your intention they will watch you
to see the miracle. Talk is the most inexpensive
thing in the world. I used to tell how good
I would be, and then Paula would fix her big
eyes on me and stare, every time I did any mean
little thing. Even Fritzy Nunky would put me
all out by taking me at my word. He&#8217;d look so
surprised when I wasn&#8217;t a saint right away quick.
Then I&#8217;d get mad, and the last state of that girl
was worse than the first. If Content heard me
quote that, she&#8217;d look at me in pious horror;
and yet I mean it. No, Melville; take the advice
of one who has had experience, don&#8217;t lay that
sweet unction of &#8216;going to be&#8217; to your soul.
&#8216;Going to be&#8217; never comes. It&#8217;s like the poetry
talk about &#8216;there is no to-morrow.&#8217; And there
isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ancient maiden, what would you recommend?&#8221;
asked the invalid, his anger disarmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
by finding Octave so promptly ready to embark
in the same boat of shortcomings with himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing I have ever found amounted
to anything was just keeping busy, as busy as
busy! If I keep doing something, I don&#8217;t have
so much time to be bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8221;&mdash;objected the repulsed aspirant
after unselfishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, I&#8217;ll roll your lounge over there by the
window. Then you can see the fun. That&#8217;ll be
better for you than moping over your own
&#8216;goings to be!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave set to work; but her arm was not so
strong as she thought it, and her lame ankle interfered
with her freedom of movement. Suddenly
she stumbled and sat down on the floor,
&#8220;with a pretty conside&#8217;ble of a bang,&#8221; as Rosetta
would have said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Octave. Don&#8217;t try again. I don&#8217;t
mind.&#8221; The tone was so genuine that the girl
opened her eyes which she had closed in a comical
grimace of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, Melville!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why what?&#8221; asked he, testily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;I believe you mean it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;but you said something about talk being
cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inexpensive, dear. I&#8217;m trying to form myself
after an approved model, of polysyllables.
Paula has really been so faithful to little Fritz
that I thought she would be pleased with me if I
was correct. She wasn&#8217;t, though. When I put
on my prettiest airs she looked at me and said,&mdash;as
only Paula can say things,&mdash;&#8216;Octave, don&#8217;t be
foolish!&#8217; It was a disappointment: but with
your example before me I&#8217;ll persevere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl had rattled on in her nonsense talk till
the pain in her ankle abated so that she could pull
herself up, and make a fresh effort. Another burst
of gayety sounded through the window, and, with
a final push, she sent Melville&#8217;s heavy lounge
rolling across the room, to bring up against the
wall with a crash.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to do it, &#8216;er bust,&#8217; as Abry-ham
says. What do you think he calls me now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Octavy&mdash;why, Octavy!&#8217;&#8221; promptly replied
her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong! I am now &#8216;Hoppity-pat.&#8217; That&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
what I call making sport of one&#8217;s infirmities.&#8221;
The girl perched herself upon the window-ledge
and watched the scene out of doors with keen
enjoyment, that was enhanced by the thought
that her bed-ridden cousin could also witness it.</p>

<p>Early in their acquaintance Fritz had tried
cajolery with the ancient burro who lived at his
ease on the rich pastures of The Snuggery farm,
and had made many attempts to ride him; but
the overtures had not been met in a friendly
spirit. Then Fritz&#8217;s temper had aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ride that homely old thing with a
head as big as its body, so there! He looks
like grandmother&#8217;s old hair-trunk, up in the attic,
with sticks for legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>But appearances are often deceitful. Don&#8217;s
look of dejection did not cover a meek or subdued
spirit. He opposed his &#8220;won&#8217;t&#8221; to Fritzy&#8217;s
&#8220;will&#8221; with a persistence that was discouraging.
On the boy&#8217;s part, however, fresh attempts were
as persistently made; and on this occasion
seemed to promise success.</p>

<p>Fritz had achieved a mount. He sat with fat
little legs extending at right angles from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
burro&#8217;s sides, trembling, but flushed with victory.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Don raised his hind quarters.</p>

<p>Fritz would have gone over the animal&#8217;s head
but for the firm hold he had of his neck.</p>

<p>Don tried sitting down. Fritz stood up, but
still astride of the donkey, and still holding on
with all his might.</p>

<p>Then the quadruped turned his head and&mdash;so
Fritz ever afterward believed&mdash;actually winked
at his determined rider; immediately rising on
all fours and setting off on a trot such as his
venerable limbs had not attempted for years.</p>

<p>Around and around the grass plot he raced,
till all at once he appeared to collapse; then he
sunk down on the ground, rolled over on his side,
and uttered a pathetic bray, as if his last hour
had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did! I did! I did ride the old thing!&#8221;
exulted the excited conqueror, and sped away to
boast of his achievement to Abraham.</p>

<p>After this amusing conclusion of the set-to
between her little brother and his victim, Octave&#8217;s
laughter was checked by an unmistakable sigh
from the boy beside her. She looked quickly
around.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;Why, Melville! What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To think that I can never do anything that
any one else can!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you are to do that which nobody
else can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville looked up eagerly; but almost instantly
his eye fell again, and, with the gloom
of hopelessness, upon the group without.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is so. I know it. I have thought a
way out,&#8221; said Octave, answering his depressed
look. &#8220;I came in here to make you promise
that you would try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never try any more experiments after
that experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with babies, of course. With a man of
science you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to meet a man of science, here
on Deer Hill Mountain, and I a&mdash;cripple?&#8221;
demanded the other, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two ways are open: one, the poorest, by
correspondence; the other I can help you to if
you will trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; said Melville; and, in his sincere liking
for Octave, he tried not say it contemptuously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I, young lord of creation; you think
I don&#8217;t know anything, don&#8217;t you? Well, I don&#8217;t,
much, and it doesn&#8217;t matter, as long as I know
enough to answer your purpose, and besides
have the tremendous honor to be your&mdash;cousin!
However, I can yet do things to further your
ideas. If I bring you this man of science will
you talk with him, or will you be cantankerous?
Mind you, I don&#8217;t do it just for you&mdash;but for
the good of the world at large. I&#8217;m a philanthropist,
in general. I always felt that I was
&#8216;cut out&#8217; for something unusual; but I didn&#8217;t
dream it was to be scientific till I became your
assistant. Say, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know any man of science; and&mdash;he
would laugh at my &#8216;cheek.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ve always sighed for adventure,
and now I shall have it. I feel like a conspirator&mdash;and
it&#8217;s a perfectly exquisite sensation.
Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave Pickel! Are you crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. To prove it I will make you promise
me something. I&mdash;I had a letter from Fritzy
Nunky to-day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>The lad&#8217;s face changed color. Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in constant correspondence with the
doctor; and that gentleman hopes to see you
within a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave&#8217;s voice, saying this, was very distinct
and firm. It was what she had really come into
the room to say, but after it was spoken she
trembled.</p>

<p>Melville lay with his dark eyes fixed on hers as
if he could scarcely credit his own ears. He was
terrified, and yet glad; he depended upon her to
stand by him, and yet he almost hated her for
what she had done. All this Octave read with
that keen intuition of hers, and if her face flushed
a little her steadfast gaze did not cease to encourage
him. &#8220;O Octave, have you really done
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Melville. The great doctor, the
great healer, is surely coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I cannot bear it!&#8221; Melville hid his face
in his hands and a shudder passed over his thin
frame.</p>

<p>A feeling of contempt for his weakness rose in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the girl&#8217;s breast, but was quickly stifled. She
forced herself to think of all he had endured, and
that he had never known the happiness of activity.
She, herself, could bear anything, any amount of
torture, to be restored to health, were she in his
stead; but Melville had suffered so much! It
was a sign that her own womanly nature was
developing in the right direction that she did
remember all this, and that her next words
should have been as wise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bear it bravely. I know you are no
coward. Besides, it will not be suffering to you,
but success. Think, Melville; you said the other
day that you wished for nothing so much as fame.
Well, then, if you are true to yourself in this, all
the world will talk of you with wonder and gratitude.
Listen&mdash;this is my plan.&#8221; The girl
pitched her voice too low for any possible overhearing;
but what she said produced a marvellous
effect upon her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if it could be true! But it is too
grand, too wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be ashamed of poor &#8216;Hoppity-pat,&#8217;
then, will you?&#8221; asked Octave, a bit wistfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;It is nonsense. It will prove to be good
for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, you doubter. It&#8217;s about as hard to
pull you up the hill of faith as&mdash;I don&#8217;t know
what! Didn&#8217;t our last experiment work &#8216;as
slick as grease?&#8217; <i>&agrave; la</i> Abry-ham. Do you suppose
I&#8217;d have handled all those frogs and hop-toads,
and nasty, slimy other things, if after the
first time I hadn&#8217;t had supreme faith in the&mdash;unnameable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville began to catch her enthusiasm.
&#8220;Octave, if&mdash;if&mdash;it should be true, wouldn&#8217;t it
be glorious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it? The best of it is that I feel it
is. &#8216;It&#8217;s borne in on me,&#8217; as Rosetta said when
she forgot to put any sugar in the jam, and it
wouldn&#8217;t jam. Say, Melville, let&#8217;s just hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hurrah, yet. But, Octave, you&#8217;re
smart! It doesn&#8217;t seem as if you could be a
girl, you think of things so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So grandma said, when I rode the kicking
horse, bareback, and forgot to mend my stockings.
Which wasn&#8217;t &#8216;thinking of things so,&#8217; it
seems to me. But, remember, if I am so bright,
I shall expect my reward&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;&#8216;To the half of my kingdom!&#8217;&#8221; interrupted
Melville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Worse than that: you are not to
tell a single soul, till the whole thing is settled.
I&#8217;d like to be of some importance, for once in my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll not breathe a single syllable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if I do something you cannot understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough! Isn&#8217;t it delightful to be&mdash;conspirators?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t kn-ow,&#8221; said the lad, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! I just believe you&#8217;d like to let the
cat out of the bag now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What difference would it make, any way?
If I say I&#8217;ll do it, I will. I won&#8217;t back out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes all the difference in the world to me.
For once I&#8217;m in a Mystery! Right in the very
heart of it, spelled with a capital M! Generally
I&#8217;m &#8216;only Octave&#8217;; now I&#8217;m somebody. I
have sighed all my life long for a romance or
something out of the common; now I&#8217;ve attained
it. Don&#8217;t balk me of my sweet revenge. Think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
of Paula Pickel&#8217;s face when she hears that &#8216;only
Octave,&#8217; was the very identical damsel that
went&mdash;but no matter! Remember that without
me there is no &#8216;man of science.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville did remember; and &#8220;wild goosey&#8221;
as the whole affair did appear, even to him, he
was so thoroughly in earnest, now, about it, and
so uplifted by Octave&#8217;s adventurous spirit, that
he readily maintained the silence she required.</p>

<p>When, that night, at locking-up-time, Octave
had not appeared, and Paula went to the room
the sisters shared in common, hoping to find the
wild-cap safe in bed, although the sheets had
been turned down and then shaken, as if the well-grown
lassie could by any possibility be hiding
within them, there was great consternation in the
household.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is always up to pranks, but she does
not generally treat us unkindly,&#8221; said the
aggrieved elder girl, feeling somehow that the
house was not a &#8220;Snuggery&#8221; without the sharpest
of the &#8220;pickles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, here is a note!&#8221; cried little Christina;
who sometimes read a love-story surreptitiously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and was akin to Octave in her desire for
a &#8220;romance.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard Octave say lots of
times that sometime she&#8217;d run away, and now I
do believe she&#8217;s done it! Read it, quick! I
found it on her pincushion. That&#8217;s the very
place run-awayers always put notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, small one, how do you know that?&#8221;
demanded Content, demurely. &#8220;I believe you&#8217;ve
been reading Luke&#8217;s &#8216;Story Paper&#8217; again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, read it any way,&#8221; urged the little girl,
in her excitement paying less heed than usual to
Content&#8217;s gentle reprimand.</p>

<p>This was the note,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Friends and Relatives, especially Paula</span>:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone, but not for good. I mean I have gone for good, as
you will all know at some future to come. I haven&#8217;t gone yet,
but I&#8217;m going. I shall come to no harm, and you need not
worry about me. When I return HE will be with me. That is,
I hope HE will. HE will if my persuasions can prevail. I have
money enough. Having none of my own,&mdash;as you all well
know, I spent it for confections,&mdash;I have been supplied with
funds by the OTHER CONSPIRATOR in the case. I do not
know when I shall return, but I shall return; for I am the &#8220;bad
penny&#8221; of the family. Don&#8217;t sit up nights, and don&#8217;t worry about
me. I am all right, and I shall &#8220;continner on.&#8221; Don&#8217;t be silly
enough to write to Aunt Ruth, for even she would have no terrors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
for me, since I go to seek HIM. So don&#8217;t worry about me.
Bother! that&#8217;s the third time I have written that perfectly
unnecessary sentence, since she who writes is</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Only Octave</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>P. S. I am in a perfect heaven of delight. I was never a conspirator
before, and I was never in a MYSTERY till now. I hope
I can hatch up one every few days hereafter, it&#8217;s so enchanting.
Just think! I, Octave Pickel, am a heroine!</p>

<p class="right">Good-bye&mdash;farewell&mdash;addio!</p>
</div>

<p>When the note was carried to Melville, and his
opinion asked, he burst into the merriest laugh
that the astonished household had ever heard
from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that you know all about it! You
two have been together a great deal of late. If
you do, you must tell us. Where is Octave?&#8221;
cried poor Paula, all in a tremble of fright and
eagerness.</p>

<p>But all the answer Melville gave, though he
did it with the same unwonted mirthfulness was,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ways of cabmen are similar, the civilized
world over; and it did not confuse Octave as it
would a less accustomed traveller to have a number
of these enterprising Jehus rush for her little
hand-bag, as she emerged from the great station,
and stood for a moment looking about her.</p>

<p>She had been half over Europe in company
with her Uncle Fritz, who never liked to journey
anywhere alone, and who found the sturdy
Octave his least troublesome &#8220;pickle&#8221; whenever
he was minded to refresh himself with the presence
of any of them. Besides, the girl had the
great gift of observation. If she had once seen
a thing she never forgot it; all its little details
had impressed themselves upon her memory with
the distinctness of a photograph.</p>

<p>She had visited the great building where she
had left the train but once before, and that once
when, in company with her guardian, she had
passed through it on her journey to Deer Hill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Yet so keenly had she observed her surroundings,
that she knew directly which way to turn
for a certain kind-faced policeman, whom she
had seen befriend a little girl while she was waiting
for their outward-bound train.</p>

<p>Now, to look for a particular policeman in a
great city like New York would have seemed to
an older person very much like looking for the
proverbial &#8220;needle in the hay-mow&#8221;; but to the
adventurous and romantic Octave it appeared the
simplest thing in the world. So, with a feeling
of perfect security, she lightly moved away from
the detaining cabbies, rigidly holding to the
little satchel which contained a hair-brush and
comb, and Melville&#8217;s well-filled pocket-book.</p>

<p>Ah! there he was, in almost the same place
on the block where she had last beheld him.
And, with the confidence of an old acquaintance,
Octave walked straight to the officer and bade
him a pleasant &#8220;Good evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; returned the gentleman in
blue uniform, looking a little surprised at the
unusual salutation. He was accustomed to be
addressed as: &#8220;Say, look here! Where is, or
what is, so and so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;I want to go to Prof. Edric von Holsneck&#8217;s.
Which is the best way, and will you get me a
carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? What? I didn&#8217;t quite &#8216;catch on,&#8217;&#8221;
was the reply.</p>

<p>Octave frowned. It was getting late, and she
was anxious to get to her destination before it
grew too dark for her to observe what Uncle
Fritz called &#8220;her bearings.&#8221; She had a wild idea
of taking a night-train back to the mountain;
but if she should find that unadvisable she would
have to look up a lodging place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go to the house of Prof. von
Holsneck,&#8221; said the girl, repeating her first
statement with the distinctness known at The
Snuggery as &#8220;Octave&#8217;s spunk.&#8221; &#8220;You certainly
must know the residence of a man so famous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t then. I know who he is and
what he is; but where he lives I never took the
trouble to find out. Why do you want to go
there? He is a big feller, too busy to be
bothered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave tossed her head with a movement of
scorn, which she considered quite womanly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
wish to see him on business. If&mdash;you don&#8217;t
know anything about him, how am I going to
find my way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough. Look in the Directory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will I find the &#8216;Directory?&#8217;&#8221; asked
the girl, tapping her foot impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the drug store on the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave&#8217;s eyes followed the glance of the policeman,
and, thanking him, she made her way to the
place and pursued her inquiries. Very speedily
she had possessed herself of all the needed information,
and set out to visit the great scientist.
An older and a wiser person would have hesitated
long before intruding upon one so fully occupied
as Prof, von Holsneck; but the girl had but one
idea in her mind, and believed that the man she
sought was the best one in the world to help her
to her object. Why, then, should she not go to
him? To her it appeared the most natural way,
when one was in need, to apply at head-quarters
for the assistance required; and she knew
very well that in neither Europe nor America
was there any one who could approach the professor
in his special branch of knowledge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>But, simple as the affair appeared to her, it did
not apparently strike others in just the same
light. The trim and prim lackey who opened
the door of the great mansion to the plainly
dressed girl stared at her in a most disconcerting
way.</p>

<p>The professor was at home; but the professor
was engaged in dining. The professor was
not to be interrupted on any pretext whatever,
when he was at table. Would she leave her
card? This last inquiry with a supercilious
sneer which, if anything had been needed to put
Octave &#8220;on her mettle&#8221; would certainly have
accomplished it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My card will be of no use, in this case. My
business is personal; and I will come in and
await the professor&#8217;s leisure.&#8221; She coolly moved
forward into the vestibule, and, much as he would
have liked to do so, the servant did not dare
refuse her entrance. Nor was he wholly to be
blamed for this reluctance. He knew, if she did
not, that his master&#8217;s hours of recreation were
few, and of labor many; and that each had a
distinct and weighty money value. The lackey&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
business was to serve and save his employer, and
in his eyes there seemed nothing which a chit of
a girl, arriving in a cheap railway hack, could
possibly want with the great man except to beg
for something or other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I wait here?&#8221; asked Octave, as the man
allowed her to stand just within the entrance and
made no effort to give her a seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will tell me your business, I will see if
you can have an audience; that is, when the
professor has finished dining,&#8221; replied the servant,
loftily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be impossible for you to understand
my business,&#8221; replied the visitor with a hauteur
fully equalling Jeems&#8217;s own. And, as he stared
at her afresh nor made any motion toward serving
her, she walked into the first room she saw
open, and quietly sat down to await developments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like this!&#8221; exclaimed the quick-tempered
girl; &#8220;I wonder what Fritzy Nunky
would say!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_174.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">One Painting Especially Captivated
Her Attention.</span> Page <a href="#Page_175">175</a>.</p>

<p>Then she began to look about her, and soon
forgot the awkwardness of her situation, the lateness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of the hour, and all the other disagreeable
things which she should have remembered. The
walls of the reception room were lined with pictures,
and there was nothing which had so
intense a fascination for Octave as a beautiful
picture. She knew at a glance that these were
such; though she could not have told why, save
that they reminded her of those she had delighted
in among the great galleries abroad, where she
had so often gone with her Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>One painting especially captivated her attention.
It was an &#8220;Interior&#8221; of a German peasant
home. In her childhood Octave had seen dozens
just such homes, and in one of them she had
passed some of the merriest days she could
remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I do believe that was painted for a
portrait of dear old Hans Schwartz! And that
is Gretchen with the baby&mdash;it really, really
is! Oh, who could have done that, and how
did it come here? Good evening, Hans; hast
thou the white cow already milked? And may
I have some of the foaming liquid for supper?
Gretchen&#8217;s brown bread would taste so good this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
very minute. Give it, Gretchen, and I&#8217;ll nurse
the baby for you.&#8221; She had thought herself
entirely alone when she entered the apartment,
and she had forgotten everything else but delight
at finding here a real&mdash;she was certain it was a
real&mdash;portrait of some of her oldest friends. So
thinking, she had not feared to talk aloud to
them; and she was recalled to herself by the
sharp surprise of hearing a voice close to her
elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be impressed with that picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave wheeled around, too unconscious of
herself to be abashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I have been in that very kitchen&mdash;I
surely have, and drank my milk out of one of
those very earthen bowls! I don&#8217;t know who
painted it, or how in the world it came here and I
came to see it, but that is Hans Schwartz&#8217;s cottage
at Erding, where we children have passed
three summers and had such fun.&#8221; Octave
paused in her eagerness, recalled to the time and
place by the striking of a clock somewhere near.</p>

<p>The clear radiance of shaded electric lights
suffused the apartment, which the girl now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
observed was simply but elegantly arranged.
For the first time a feeling of timidity stole over
her, and a sense that she had intruded arose to
trouble her. It might be that she had made a
mistake; if so, the only thing left for her to do
was to get away as quickly as she could. She
looked into the face of the old man who had
spoken to her, and noticed with satisfaction that
he was as simply attired and as every-day-like in
his appearance as herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me, sir, if it would be possible
for me to have a few minutes&#8217; conversation with
the gentleman who owns this house,&mdash;the great
professor of chemistry, and&mdash;lots of other
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man smiled. &#8220;On what subject, my
child?&#8221; He did not disconcert her as the
liveried servant had done, and, if he was surprised
to see her occupying the great man&#8217;s gallery, and
enjoying his pictures without leave or license, he
was too kindly to say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;This dear old fellow is somebody&#8217;s grandfather,&#8221;
thought Octave, reminded by his gentleness
of Grandmother Amy; &#8220;I wonder if he is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
sort of upper servant; he looks as if he felt at
home.&#8221; Aloud she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had rather not try to explain it to any one
except the professor, or to some one he will
recommend, if he is too busy to see me. It is
about a discovery that a boy made. I don&#8217;t
understand it myself, but the boy wrote it all
down on paper, and I have seen it act. I do
hope he will see me, for I believe he would be
interested, if he heard the whole story.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, Octave&#8217;s suspicion that her
companion was &#8220;somebody&#8217;s grandfather&#8221; was
confirmed. A merry little child ran into the
room, and with a scream of delight that she had
escaped her nurse&#8217;s hands, bounded upon the old
man&#8217;s knee. &#8220;O grandpa! don&#8217;t let her take
me to bed, will you? I haven&#8217;t played you were
a bear for three days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three days, is it, sweetheart? That is long
indeed, for little people to remember. Maybe I
will play bear, soon; just now I am busy. Go
and tell the good <i>bonne</i> that I wish you to stay
up one half-hour longer; then you may come
and sit upon my lap, and hear me talk with this
young girl.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>The child ran swiftly away, singing something
in French; and thereby puzzling poor
Octave&#8217;s brain still more. A baby of three,
possibly four, years old, who talked in excellent
English and sang carols in French, was astonishing
enough; but not so greatly such as to be
met at the entrance by pomposity in livery and
find the interior, if far richer, as unpretentious
as the living room at The Snuggery.</p>

<p>Her puzzle was destined to increase. &#8220;Now,
my dear, if you will show me the papers, and tell
me what you wish, I shall be happy to serve
you,&#8221; said the old man, stroking his white beard
and looking into her astonished eyes with the
most encouraging of smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you? Are you Prof. Edric von
Holsneck?&#8221; faltered Octave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was he you came to see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, si-ir; but&mdash;but I&mdash;perhaps I had better
go away. I didn&#8217;t think so at first, but now it
seems like presumption for me to talk to&mdash;to you.&#8221;
Try as she would, the girl could not reconcile the
real professor with her preconceived notion of
him. She had fancied a tall, stern, spectacled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
person, in a laboratory, and with learning fairly
oozing from his gaunt person. But this man,
he might have been&mdash;anybody!</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no presumption in any honest
person&#8217;s talking to any other. Evidently you
thought you had something worth saying or you
would not have taken the trouble to come and
try to say it. I shall be glad to hear or read the
matter you have in hand.&#8221; His manner, rather
than his words, said also that he would be glad
to do so at once, for wasted moments were a
thing unknown in his day&#8217;s calendar.</p>

<p>Octave became herself again on the instant.
All her timidity vanished, and with the simple
directness of manner which some found so charming
because it was so wholly natural and unconscious
of self, she told him Melville&#8217;s story. The
little grandchild came in, and, evidently accustomed
to be quiet when her grandfather so
desired, nestled herself in his arms and lay there
still, with her eyes fixed upon Octave&#8217;s face, and
apparently listening closely to every word she
uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The papers,&#8221; said Prof. von Holsneck, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
she had related with lucid brevity all that had led
up to Melville&#8217;s discovery. His eyes had gained
in brightness and his whole manner had lost the
look of age and fatigue it had worn when Octave
first beheld him. Knowledge was to this man
what a draught of wine is to some others.</p>

<p>Swiftly Octave opened the closely guarded
pocket-book, and gave the professor some simple
lines of writing, with odd looking formul&aelig;.
To her, they were less intelligible than Greek;
but to the gentleman they were a familiar language.
Their meaning, also, appeared to have
startled and delighted him; for he suddenly laid
down the sheets of paper and looked at Octave
searchingly. &#8220;Do you tell me that this was prepared
by a boy of fourteen years? An invalid,
and alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. He has had good instruction until
within the last six months, when the professor
who used to live on Deer Hill Mountain removed
to the South. My cousin Melville cares for
nothing so much as study, and he has had no
chance to do anything else. I don&#8217;t know much
about boys, but it seems to me he is awfully
clever, is he not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;He is more. He is a genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is the &#8216;stuff,&#8217; good for anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time will prove, and some exhaustive experiments.
It interests me. I will look into it.
If you will give me your address, I will write to
him.&#8221; Octave drew out her card, but, as she was
about to hand it to her host, he said, &#8220;How did
you come here? With friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came alone, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone! Where shall you spend the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;hoped to get through in time to go
home, but I fear it is too late. Will you be good
enough to tell me some hotel that is nearer the
station than the <i>Metropole</i>? I want to get back
as early in the morning as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the <i>Hotel Metropole</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; we stopped there for a week when
we came to America with Uncle Fritz. But it is
a long way down, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great man looked at the girl who was but
a child, but who seemed so little dismayed at
hunting up a lodging place in a great city alone,
and after dark. There was nothing bold in her
manner, if there was perfect fearlessness&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
fearlessness of innocent ignorance. Then his
eyes fell down upon the little grandchild in his
arms. &#8220;My dear young lady, you are too young
to have done this thing alone, and I cannot let
you go away to-night. You must remain with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sir, I did not dream of making myself
such a trouble to you. I came only to find out
for poor Melville if there was anything in his
idea, and I knew nobody could tell me as well as
you. I couldn&#8217;t bear to have him bothered by
people who did not know exactly; it will be such
a glorious thing for him if he is right, and he
couldn&#8217;t bear suspense.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s flattering candor was pleasant to the
learned man, for there is no one so wise but that
he likes appreciation; besides, the frank face
pleased him in other ways, and he was minded
to hear the history of the cottage she had recognized
by its portrait on his walls.</p>

<p>He touched a button, and the servant who had
treated Octave with so much contempt appeared.
&#8220;Send away this young lady&#8217;s cab. She will
pass the night here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Octave held out her purse, but the professor
waived it aside. &#8220;You are my guest. If I mistake
not, the most notable I have entertained for
many a day.&#8221; The girl understood that he
referred to Melville&#8217;s possible discovery, for the
same eager light had come into the bright eyes
of the scientist, and she felt no undue elation at
his words. She, the messenger, was nothing to
him but a messenger; and, with a funny little
grimace at herself, she reflected that even in this
most important transaction of her young life she
was still &#8220;only Octave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you smiling, girl?&#8221; asked the
grandchild, slipping her hand confidingly into
the young visitor&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;At foolish thoughts, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor roused himself. &#8220;Have you
had your dinner, Miss&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave Pickel. No, sir; but that is of no
consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be of the highest consequence to a
growing girl. Run, little one, and ask grandmother
to have supper prepared for our guest.
And Pickel, you said? The name commends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
itself to me. I am indebted to those of that
name for many great kindnesses. It may not be
the same family; yet you recognized the Erding
cottage. Did you ever live at Munich?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my home,&#8221; responded Octave, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great publishing house of &#8216;Pickel &amp;
Pickel&#8217;&mdash;do you know that, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I not? Since I am part of the &#8216;&amp;
Pickel.&#8217; The head of the house is Fritz; and
Franz, his brother, was my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor held out his hands in cordial
greeting. &#8220;Then, indeed, you are in the house
of friends. Now, while the supper is made
ready, tell me about the cottage the picture of
which my son painted.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a most unexpected journey that the
over-busy scientist took, on the following morning,
with the young girl whose audacious appeal to
him had resulted with so much success to her.
That is, it would have been considered audacious
by the hosts of anxious men who were always
coming and going, eager to consult the professor
on matters of grave importance; and obliged,
many and many a time, to defer that consultation
till &#8220;a more convenient occasion.&#8221; She had not
only made her own &#8220;occasion,&#8221; but had not even
dreamed that any formality had been necessary.</p>

<p>As they neared the little station at the foot of
Deer Hill Mountain, Octave&#8217;s overflowing spirits
found voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had such a lovely time! I never had
a pleasanter visit in all my life, and I do appreciate
all that you and sweet Mrs. Professor have
done for me. Uncle Fritz may be able to find
some way of returning some of the kindness.
But, there is something you don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>More than one among the passengers in the car
recognized the fine head of Professor von Holsneck,
and pointed out the great man as a person
to be seen once in a lifetime; but to those who
beheld him and had known of his mighty intellect
alone, he was to appear in a new character. He
might have been the simplest traveller of them
all, journeying into green pastures along with a
favorite grandchild, so unpretending and joyous
was he. For, great as he was,&mdash;because he was
so great, it may be,&mdash;he had learned the happy
secret of being true to the nature God had given
him, and of tossing aside care like a useless garment,
whenever he dared take time from his
grave labors for a bit of rest.</p>

<p>Octave found him as companionable as Fritzy,
and far more so than Paula would have been on
such a trip. Her tongue rattled from one subject
to another with humming-bird swiftness, if not
with so much of grace. Professor von Holsneck
found her infinitely diverting, and grew brighter
and more rested as the distance lessened; but it
was not till they were almost ready to leave the
train that Octave treated him to a full account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
her &#8220;running away,&#8221; and the puzzle she had left
for her family to solve.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear child, if you had told me that
last night, I would have relieved their anxiety by
a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? I do not want it relieved. It
isn&#8217;t every day I have a chance to do things out
of the common, and you wouldn&#8217;t have had the
heart to disappoint me when I did, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly would!&#8221; replied the professor,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Then it is well I didn&#8217;t tell. Paula will
be just dying to know what I have done and
where I have been; but you see she isn&#8217;t to
know, yet; neither she nor anybody. This is a
<i>Mystery</i>&mdash;a capital-letter MYSTERY! And it
isn&#8217;t to be divulged until we are all ready for the
<i>denouement</i>. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very clearly, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that saucily, but
because there is so little time to explain. We
don&#8217;t wish anybody to know anything about
what Melville hopes or what he may have discovered
until he is all ready to test it. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
you are sure,&mdash;perfectly, perfectly sure,&mdash;and it
has been tried in other ways ever so many times,
then he is to try it on himself; when the great
surgeon says the time has come. We want him
to show his courage and get his fame all at
once&mdash;in a blaze of glory! Poor laddie! he
hasn&#8217;t had many blazes of glory, but he&#8217;s had
lots of blazing tempers! He&#8217;s almost as spunky
as I am. So, when we get to The Snuggery, you
are to be&mdash;<span class="smcap">He</span>, I am a <span class="smcap">Heroine</span>, and this is
part of my romance. I just have astonished
Paula Pickel for once in my life, and I don&#8217;t want
you to go and spoil the fun. You won&#8217;t, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I can help it,&#8221; answered the <i>savant</i>,
enjoying the nonsense like a boy. &#8220;But I may
do so unintentionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t let you. If you go to say anything
you should not, I will frown; and when I frown,
you are to stop short off, no matter what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is destined to make me appear very
silly, I fear. I shall be sure to say the thing you
do not wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not; and you won&#8217;t mind being rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
silly for once, when you are so very wise most of
the time, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the wisdom, my dear. I
often feel as if I had but learned the alphabet of
wisdom, and that most imperfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s tone had become grave, and of
the truth of his conviction there could be no
doubt. Octave looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Professor von Holsneck! If you are
not wise, who in this world is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more we learn the greater is the vista
of knowledge which opens before us. What I
have gained in understanding is as nothing, nothing,
to that I could desire, and, being almost at
the end of life, that I must leave unknown;
unless, indeed, in that other life I shall be permitted
to advance forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;what must you think of poor me!&#8221;
cried Octave, abashed at last by a thought of
her own acquirements in comparison with his.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are a very charming child,&#8221;
responded the great man, so heartily and affectionately
that her smiles returned.</p>

<p>When they had reached their station, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
been driven up the mountain side in one of the
lumbering stages which were on hand for the
accommodation of stray passengers, their talk
reverted to Germany and the son of the professor,
who was still there, prosecuting his studies in
art, and whose attainments seemed, to judge by
the fond parent&#8217;s talk, to be something wonderful
indeed.</p>

<p>The truth was, that Octave had walked straight
into the deepest corner of his heart by her swift
recognition of a humble scene which that absent
son had depicted on his canvas, and had sent
across the sea to convince his father that the
absence was not unfruitful of good result. An
artist&#8217;s career had been the last the professor
would have chosen for his boy; but he was wise
enough to let each nature work out its own salvation
in its own way. &#8220;A good artist would have
been a spoiled scientist,&#8221; he had philosophically
reasoned with himself; though his disappointed
hopes were sometimes still hard to bear. So,
when Octave&#8217;s ignorant tongue had told him that
the boy had been right, he had been better
pleased than if she had brought him a costly
offering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Seeing it pleased him, if not wholly understanding
why, the girl had gone on to describe in
detail all the familiar scenes in which her previous
summers had been passed; and the description
brought the absent son&#8217;s present environment
in clearest view to the father&#8217;s mental sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down the little path there by the gate, Hans
always went of a morning with his tin dinner-pail,
and his spade or shovel over his shoulder, the
little best room,&mdash;I know that is the one they
have given your boy,&mdash;the great bed stands so
and so; and there is an old black chest of
drawers. In those, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but he
keeps all his pictures, and wet sketches, to get
them out of the dust. Gretchen is eternally
stirring up a dust, you must know, and then laying
it down again with a wet rag. Paula used to
sketch in oils, and she and Gretchen were always
in a riot on account of the &#8216;fuzz&#8217; sticking so to
the paint. She used to threaten putting her
horrid daubs in the chest then, but I wouldn&#8217;t let
her. I wasn&#8217;t going to have my Sunday frock
spoiled and smutched by green and yellow spots,
would you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;No, I would not,&#8221; responded the professor,
heartily, if absently. He was seeing, at that
very moment, the little Dutch bed-chamber and
his happy, careless lad, putting away with the
forethought he exercised only upon his &#8220;work&#8221;
the half-finished sketch he had just been over the
hill to make. Octave laughed, and her laugh
recalled the old man to the actual, and to the
knowledge that their stage had drawn up before
the white palings of an old-fashioned house, in
whose wide doorway a group of curious young
faces were pictured.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221; said Octave, springing down
and standing with a great show of dignity, while
the professor clambered after her.</p>

<p>Then they walked up the gravel path together,
and just before the group of watchers Octave
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I did come back; and this is&mdash;<span class="smcap">He</span>!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Ruth</span> was in great perplexity. She
did not intend to let her mother see that she was
but when had her tell-tale countenance ever
hidden anything from the eyes which watched it
so closely and fondly?</p>

<p>So it was of no avail that she sat quietly down
with her sewing, by the open window of their
pleasant apartment at the sea-side hotel where
they were staying, and tried to look indifferent.
Mother Amy&#8217;s gentle voice broke the stillness at
once.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does thee know that there is anything?
I mean&mdash;what does thee mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is troubling thee, my child?&#8221; asked
the old lady, smiling at Ruth&#8217;s confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old subject, Mother Amy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, not my health. The Lord has been
very good to me. I have promise of living yet
awhile, to do His work; if so pleases Him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;No, not thy health. If no one troubled me
more than thee does, sweet mother, I should
find life all too comfortable. It is the children&mdash;the
&#8216;pickles.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee promised to leave care behind thee
when we left The Snuggery, and thee has bravely
tried to keep thy word, though it has been hard
at times. What is new about them, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter from Rosetta which puzzles
me. I don&#8217;t know if thee is well enough to hear
it, but I should like advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth, I am well; and thee shall have the
advice for what it may be worth to thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth drew a yellow envelope from her pocket.
The letter which it contained was much messed
and rumpled, and the blotches of ink were visible
even across the room; so that to look upon
it was painful to Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s fastidious
eyes. Evidently the writer had concocted
the epistle with great labor and at broken intervals,
and her unaccustomed fingers had found
the task an almost impossible one.</p>

<p>The letter began,&mdash;</p>



<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span><span class="smcap">Dear Mam, that is Ruth</span>:</p>

<p>I ain&#8217;t a writin&#8217; this to the old laidy, becos I no that You don&#8217;t

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rosetta Perkins</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ruth! Ruth! give me the letter. Thee cannot
have read it aright,&#8221; said Mother Amy,
laughing merrily; for her daughter had read the
epistle through exactly as it had been written,
without punctuation and with all the imperfect
spelling accented as far as was possible to do so.</p>

<p>The daughter passed the paper over into her
mother&#8217;s hands and curiously watched her face
while she endeavored to make its meaning intelligible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;Well, and what does thee think of it? Can
thee guess what mischief those young ones have
been after now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I cannot,&#8221; said Mrs. Kinsolving, after
a second and slower perusal. &#8220;It does not
appear to be anything serious, however. I
would not worry about it, if I were in thy place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I help it, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, indeed, my Ruth, till thee is made over
new! Thee began to worry in thy cradle, and
thee will keep it up until the end, I fear. I wish
thee would not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been something going on that
Rosetta has been troubled about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosetta is troubled about many things, from
&#8216;pie-crust to religion,&#8217; as thee has so often
remarked. It is, likely, something about Abraham
and the stock; and we have known Abraham&#8217;s
trustworthiness these many years, although
Rosetta still feels a care over him as if he were
a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>No surer symptom of Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s
physical improvement could have been
found than in her mirthfulness of mood; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
those who heard her light jests could easily see
where Ruth had acquired her odd ways of looking
at life. Mother Amy was religious to her
heart&#8217;s core, and the sweetness and gladness of
her religion shone through her words and lovely
features as the light within shines through an
uncurtained window on a winter&#8217;s night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, if thee thinks thee is well enough to
be left, I would like to take a run up to the farm
and see with my own eyes if anything is amiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, if thee likes, my child. I am certainly
well enough; besides, in this kind family are
many willing hands to do for me the slightest
service I may require. The young serving-woman
that has charge of our rooms appears
to be fond of me. If her mistress is willing,
thee might engage her to look after me in thy
absence, and then both thee and I would feel
safe and independent. As much as one human
being can ever be independent of the souls
around him,&#8221; concluded the dear old lady,
gravely.</p>

<p>So it was settled; and, hoping to be away from
her post of love and duty but for a little while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Ruth Kinsolving tied on her gray bonnet, and
pinned her gray shawl about her shapely shoulders,
and set off for home.</p>

<p>Some days had passed since Octave&#8217;s disappearance
in a &#8220;Mystery,&#8221; and her no less
strange reappearance with &#8220;Him&#8221;; but no
explanation had she vouchsafed of the affair, and
the curiosity which had succeeded anxiety remained
in the breasts of the other young householders,
to torment them with ever-growing
strength.</p>

<p>Paula had written several letters to Aunt Ruth
on the subject, but she was prudent and thoughtful
by nature, and the recollection that no harm
seemed to have come of the adventure, and that
Aunt Ruth was easily disturbed, had restrained
her from posting them. They still reposed in
the bottom of her pretty writing-desk, ready for
dispatching whenever it should seem advisable.</p>

<p>Even Content had been moved to interference,
and had urged Octave first, and afterward Melville,
to disclose the &#8220;Mystery&#8221;; but to all
persuasions the &#8220;conspirators&#8221; turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t you tell <i>me</i>, if I promise never-no-never-s&#8217;long&#8217;s-I-live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
to tell nobody else?&#8221; asked
little Fritz, coaxingly. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you go to,
Octave, and who was the old man what came
home with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t tell, any how you fix it,
dearie. I&#8217;ve promised Melville, and he&#8217;s promised
me; but by and by everybody will know.
You must all be patient. Grandmother says that
&#8216;patience is a virtue.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does grandmother know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; that is, not about this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor Aunty Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Least of all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she does, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She cannot, Fritz. How? The girls have
all said that they wouldn&#8217;t worry her about it,
and Melville hasn&#8217;t&mdash;that I&#8217;m sure of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, Fritzy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! I guess I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m a &#8216;Mystery,&#8217;
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You midget! You don&#8217;t even know what a
&#8216;Mystery&#8217; is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I do, Paula and Content, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
hunted it out in the dic&mdash;dictionary book, and
they told me when I asted them. I do know,
so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what it is, and I&#8217;ll believe you
understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pro&mdash;some kind of a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! You&#8217;re precocious!&#8221; said Octave,
half vexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t no such a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean anything bad, Fritzy
darling. It means that you are an unusually
smart boy. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I knew that. Abry-ham and
Rosetta and all of &#8217;em says that,&#8221; answered the
little lad, complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritz, your vanity is great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me and I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said the child,
returning to the subject dearer to him just then
than his own perfections.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritz, if I would tell anybody, it would be
you. But I cannot; I&#8217;ve promised, and I
wouldn&#8217;t break my word. I&#8217;m sure you couldn&#8217;t
ask that, little brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Fritz, gravely, with sober memories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
of that dreadful time when he broke his own
word, and so nearly forfeited his right to be a
gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, if you haven&#8217;t promised there is no reason
why you should not tell me how Aunt Ruth
heard what I did. I&#8217;m sorry, for I don&#8217;t want
to worry her, even if I am all right in what I
have done, and she will be proud of me when it
is all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she?&#8221; This was a new view of the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so. Anyway, she&#8217;ll be &#8216;as proud as
proud&#8217; of Melville. So it won&#8217;t matter so much
about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you give me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, siree. I won&#8217;t tell for less than a quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mercenary little wretch! I haven&#8217;t but
ten cents to my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Borry of Melville. He always has lots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to run in debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! How much have you got, anyway?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Octave took out a very flat little porte-monnaie
and emptied its contents into Fritzy&#8217;s dirty, waiting
palms. The amount was eleven cents and
one bad German coin, which the little boy said
he would take &#8220;in case it should be good sometime.&#8221;
Then, for value received, he imparted the
information that &#8220;Rosetta wrote a letter. She
wrote it with her tongue and her fingers, and
making up faces the worsest that ever was! An&#8217;
when it was done I drove to the post-office in my
pony-cart, and mailed it, an&#8217; the postmaster he
gave me a stamp, an&#8217; I licked it on.&#8221; After
which circumstantial evidence Octave concluded
that there could be no doubt about the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then all I have to say is, that first
thing we know, Aunt Ruth will come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she?&#8221; asked Fritz, eagerly. Then, as
a shadow fell across the path, he looked up.
&#8220;Ginger!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;there she is now!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an instant silence reigned; but it was
not in the frank natures of either Octave or Fritz
to tremble long before the apparition which had
appeared so suddenly in their midst. Fritz flew
to the arms outstretched to receive him with a
genuineness of joy that was very sweet to Ruth&#8217;s
heart, and Octave&#8217;s momentary hesitation vanished
at the first kindly smile from her relative&#8217;s
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Aunt Ruth, I am glad to see you,
after all,&#8221; she said, coming forward as Fritz was
deposited upon the ground; and Ruth&#8217;s clear
gaze rested on the girl with fond surprise. She
did not remember to have left Octave so well
grown and fair of face; and yet a second&#8217;s thought
showed that no very great change could have
been accomplished during the few weeks of her
absence.</p>

<p>Fritz and Octave had been the aunt&#8217;s favorites.
She had not even attempted to deny that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
fact to herself; there was something akin to her
own outspoken nature in their characters, and it
was with the most implicit confidence she believed
that, whoever might have been misbehaving while
she had been away, it could not be Octave.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Fritzy had been in scrapes
innumerable; he could not exist without them;
but the scrapes of a child &#8220;going on nine&#8221; are
rarely very serious. Her mind naturally fell
upon Paula, whom she liked least of all her
nieces; and it was with a prejudgment that
Paula had been trying something romantic and
out of the common that she had returned to The
Snuggery to investigate.</p>

<p>Paula, poor Paula! The irreproachable and
really lovely girl, whose faults might be disagreeable
because they touched so closely upon the
faults of others, but who fully intended to be
just perfect, and was all the time anxiously investigating
her own motives, lest there should be
some flaw therein.</p>

<p>The one fault of which the elder &#8220;Miss
Pickel&#8221; had been most painfully self-conscience
was her own selfishness and love of ease.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Wise Grandmother Kinsolving had seen this,
and had put the girl at the head of affairs, believing
that a position of trust would best counteract
Paula&#8217;s tendency to indolence and fault-finding.
Mother Amy had found that congenial labor is a
happy antidote to the poison of sin, and believed
implicitly in the old &#8220;word&#8221; that &#8220;Satan still
will find some task for idle hands to do.&#8221; Well,
then, whoever fell under the guidance of the far-seeing
Friend was rarely left to be a victim of
the evil spirit&#8217;s wiles.</p>

<p>But, as soon as she heard that her aunt had
arrived, Paula reflected with no small degree of
pride on her excellent management. She considered
that she had earned a right to be a bit
self-complacent, since, during her brief reign,
accidents had been fewer than usual, and &#8220;the
children&#8221; had really acquitted themselves very
well indeed.</p>

<p>So, delaying only long enough to complete the
very pretty afternoon toilet she was making,
&#8220;Miss Pickel&#8221; descended to receive her aunt,
with what Uncle Fritz would have judged a very
graceful greeting, and of which his loving heart
would have been most proud.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>But prejudiced Aunt Ruth saw only a prim
little maiden, dressed far beyond the necessities
of the occasion, and read in the momentary
delay that dressing had occasioned the tardy welcome
of one who was conscious of having something
to hide.</p>

<p>Even the unobservant Christina noticed the
coldness of the aunt&#8217;s kiss, as compared with
that she had bestowed on each of the others, who
had not tarried for any toilet making before they
bade her welcome home. As for Octave, she
looked up in such visible surprise that honest
Ruth was convicted of unfairness, and tried to
remedy the mischief by scrupulous inquiries
after Paula&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly well,&#8221; answered Paula, thanking
her relative sweetly, and inquiring in her own
turn after their grandmother and her home-coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will not return for some time yet, if I
can prevent it,&#8221; answered Ruth, with considerable
sternness. &#8220;She is used to quiet, and I should
not like to have her improvement all for nothing,
as it would be if she came back just yet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;Will you have lunch or dinner now?&#8221; asked
the deputy house-mistress, trying to be perfect
in her behavior.</p>

<p>It was very odd, Ruth thought, to have anyone
asking her in her own house if she would
have something to eat, as if she had been a
stranger; and somehow it did not strike her at
all pleasantly. The pretty young Quakeress
was, in reality, a little out of temper. She had
been vexed at having to take this unexpected
journey home, and, with her propensity for worrying,
was already fancying a thousand evils
which might have befallen her precious mother
at the hands of that ignorant serving-maid to
whom she had been entrusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not hungry. It is not our habit
to lunch at irregular hours; or it <i>was</i> not our
habit, when I was mistress here. Where is
Rosetta?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone to the village for an afternoon&#8217;s visit,&#8221;
replied Paula, surprised in her turn by her aunt&#8217;s
tone, and more hurt by it than she would have
cared to show.</p>

<p>At this news Octave rejoiced, for she preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
telling her aunt as much other &#8220;Mystery&#8221; affair
as she was free to divulge, and not have the
account garbled by any other&#8217;s report. Oddly
enough, her proceeding had never looked such
a bold and strange one as it had during the few
minutes since Aunt Ruth had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why I do feel so queer! I&#8217;m sure
I did nothing wrong, nothing I would not do
again, if I was placed in just such a position.
And it is all coming out so beautifully, too.
Oh, dear! How shall I get a chance to talk
with her first!&#8221; thought Octave, growing more
and more perplexed.</p>

<p>But presently Ruth&#8217;s eyes begun to wander
afresh around the apartment. There was one
other who had failed in her welcome, and that
the sweet-faced Content. Octave interpreted the
glance in her quick way, and replied to it. &#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s lamb and caper sauce this afternoon, Aunt
Ruth. It&#8217;s the first tantrum Melville has had in
some time. He really is the most improved
boy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was plenty of room for it,&#8221; interrupted
Ruth, grimly. &#8220;What was the &#8216;tantrum&#8217;
about?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Octave colored. She could not answer without
involving somebody else in possible blame, and
that one she who, strangely enough, seemed
already to have incurred it. Had the family
been asked who would have the best record to
show the absent house-mistress upon her return,
the answer would have been unanimous, &#8220;Paula.&#8221;
It was incomprehensible, yet it seemed true, that
now Paula was the only one found wanting in
favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the &#8216;tantrum&#8217; about, Octave?
Thee must tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a trifle, Aunt Ruth. If you please, I
would rather not tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As thee likes. Christina, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Christina, the peace lover, was frightened.
She tell tales of anybody! Least of all, of
Melville and Paula!</p>

<p>The affair was really, as Octave had said, one of
the slightest import; but because of their hesitation
it grew to assume tremendous consequence
in Ruth&#8217;s mind. There was evidently something
they all wished to hide, and a very natural feeling
of resentment filled her heart. Here, in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
own home, over which, under the gentle supervision
of her mother, she had reigned supreme
during all her maiden life, she was flouted by a
parcel of young creatures who had intruded upon
her peace, uninvited, and unconscious, even, of
that intrusion. They seemed so to take it for
granted that she was as pleased to have them
there as they had been to come! and she did not
like it at all; she had only received them because
her mother had said it was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if none will tell, then I will go and
learn from Melville himself. He has faults
enough, but he is not afraid to give an answer
when it is demanded.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, and with a motion which seemed to
impart to the rustling gray gown which clothed
her tall figure an air of great austerity, Ruth led
the way to the cripple&#8217;s room. Scarcely knowing
whether they were wanted or not, but with
the natural curiosity of their age, the others
followed in a body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Aunt Ruth! When did you come to
town?&#8221; was Melville&#8217;s rather disrespectful salutation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;I came home this afternoon. I am pleased to
see thee in such fine spirits. I had heard that
thee was in a &#8216;tantrum.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was, a little while ago; but Content
has cured me. She&#8217;s a great pacifier of family
strife, Aunt Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; replied the aunt, kissing with
fervency the niece who had sprung to her side
in glad surprise. &#8220;Our little Content is always
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scuse me, Aunt Ruthy, but she isn&#8217;t. She
told a story one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Fritzy, I think that could not be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep; she told me so her own self; didn&#8217;t
you, Content?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did tell him so, Aunt Ruth; but it was
not here that I was guilty of the sin. We were
comparing notes, and finding out that everybody
does wrong, even though they do not mean to,&#8221;
said Content, in her low voice and with a painful
flush on her fair cheek. It was one thing to be
confidentially sympathetic with Fritzy, in the
privacy of her own room and the sacredness of a
Sunday afternoon chat; it was quite another to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
have her fault published &#8220;on the housetop&#8221; as
it were, and as a sort of send-off to her aunt&#8217;s
unexpected return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; said Octave, suddenly.
Then stopped, as if she had forgotten herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee declares what, Octave?&#8221; asked Ruth,
sharply, and sitting suddenly down upon the foot
of Melville&#8217;s lounge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to say it, but something
appears to have come over all of us and set us
all by the ears, just the minute you came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate speech, and Octave swiftly
recognized the fact; but she could see no way
of setting it right, so perforce she left it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to setting people &#8216;by
the ears,&#8217; Octave; and if thee and thy sisters
are disturbed by my coming there must be some
reason for it. I may as well tell all that I had a
very peculiar letter from Rosetta Perkins, and it
is that has sent me home on this flying visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville caught the word &#8220;flying,&#8221; and, in his
relief that it was only such an one, he winked at
Octave. Aunt Ruth intercepted the wink and
the swift glance of sympathy which answered it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
More than ever was she convinced that there was
mischief afoot, and that she was none too soon
upon the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ruth, did you bring Rosetta&#8217;s letter
with you?&#8221; asked Octave, so suddenly that the
other replied without thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it is in my hand-bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let us see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it seems to have made mischief.
There is something wrong somewhere, and I, for
one, don&#8217;t know where; but I should like to. If
I see what she has said, then I can tell just how
to straighten it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth was sorely puzzled; but she smiled at
Octave&#8217;s ingenuous confession that she desired
to fix things up to suit the occasion; yet some way
she did not misconstrue it, nor in any degree
include her favorite in the general blame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee can read the letter if thee chooses;
read it aloud. But thee is not likely to make
much sense out of it. I could not, therefore I
came home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Kinsolving took the letter from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
satchel and gave it to Octave, who attempted to
read it aloud, as she had been directed. But the
feat, for that fun-loving girl, was an impossibility.
She would enunciate a few word and then stop
to laugh, which, in itself, would have been confusing,
had the epistle been most carefully worded;
but, composed as it was and ambiguous in the
extreme, the others found the suspense more
than they could endure; so it was finally handed
over to Content, and she managed to get through
it after a fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does it all mean?&#8221; asked that girl,
smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means, as far as I can translate it, that
there has been some strange occurrence here.
Something that would not have happened if
mother and I had been at home. I have come
here, as I told thee, to find out what it is. Paula,
thee is the eldest. What has happened that
should not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Paula did not answer. Her eye unconsciously
flew to Octave, and then dropped upon the carpet.
Her new habit of self-denial would not
allow her to convict her sister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Ruth frowned. &#8220;What is it, Content?&#8221;</p>

<p>But poor Content flushed and paled, yet
neither would she reply; that is, in such terms as
her aunt desired. &#8220;I would rather not tell, Aunt
Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then thee acknowledges there is something,
and thee knows what that something is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; said Content.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall get to it, then; Fritzy, what has
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I run Don into the side of the stable and
barked his sides all off.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a relief for all to laugh; the confession
was made in such honest trepidation, for Fritz
knew that old Don was the &#8220;apple of his Aunt
Ruth&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Christina, will thee tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentle tone assumed when she was addressed
sent soft-hearted little Christina into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wild horses won&#8217;t drag it out of me, Aunt
Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Paula, I shall hold thee responsible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Thee was left in charge. Come with me to my
room. I will hear thy story there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Aunt Ruth; there is no blame to be
put upon anybody but me. I, Octave, was
what &#8216;happened&#8217;; I always am, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was visible relief in all the faces of the
group, save that of the self-accused. Yes, and
save in that of Aunt Ruth herself. At that
instant it was perfectly evident to all that the
judgment which would be meted out to Octave
would be far more lenient than it would have
been in any other case.</p>

<p>An expression of keenest regret stole over the
young Friend&#8217;s features; and a look of astonishment
that cut Octave to the heart. But she did
not gaze upon it long, for, with an impetuous
rush, she fell upon Ruth&#8217;s neck and hid her face
on the gray-clad shoulder. &#8220;Yes, Aunt Ruth;
and I am sorry; but I should do it again, just
the same. No, I mean, not perhaps not the
same&mdash;but, oh, dear! I&mdash;I believe, upon my
word, I&#8217;m crying; and I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know
why!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> by one the cousins who could do so
passed out of the room, leaving Melville, who
could not go had he wished, as sole witness of
the interview between Ruth and Octave.</p>

<p>The sight of the merry Octave in tears was
one so unusual and so depressing that little Fritz
set up a dismal wail, which Christina checked
her own more silent grief to soothe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, little brother; Aunt Ruthy loves
Octave ever so! She&#8217;ll not scold her very hard
for running away and being a heroine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she will! And Octave cried! I never,
no never, all my life long, saw my Octave a-cryin&#8217;.
I&mdash;I wish the old thing had staid to home; so
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is her home, Fritz; and it is you
and I who have put her out of it. That&#8217;s what
Luke said. He said we &#8216;kerried on so like possessed&#8217;
that we &#8216;jest clean druv&#8217; grandmother
and Aunt Ruth away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s no sech a thing! An&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell Luke
Tewksbury so to his old face!&#8221; retorted Fritz,
indignantly, and forgetting to cry. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
mean boy. He hitched my mare up to the
harvest-wagon and said she had got to draw
a&mdash;&#8217;bout twenty tons of stuff. He did, so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Christina did not dispute the assertion, and the
picture of the tiny pony hitched before a lumber
wagon was one that elicited her keenest sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, dear; he didn&#8217;t really do
it, and you can ask Aunt Ruth to make Luke
stop teasing you. I am glad she has come
home, though it did seem so sort of upsetting
at first. She&#8217;ll straighten out all the crooked
things, I fancy, she&#8217;s a &#8216;powerful hand to manage,&#8217;
Rosetta says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s bray coming to his ears at that moment
diverted the thoughts of Fritz from anything
unpleasant, and he rushed out of doors to try a
bare-back ride. This was a feat he had never
yet accomplished, but which he daily attempted
with an enthusiasm and courage worthy of a better
cause. &#8220;Fritzy, he never gins up licked,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
was Abraham&#8217;s as daily comment; and this was
uttered in an indescribable tone, which seemed to
put the child to a greater determination than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, Fritzy,&#8221; called Christina; &#8220;don&#8217;t
go and hurt yourself just as Aunt Ruth has come
home&#8221;; which suggested that it would not be so
much of a matter if he did so at other times.</p>

<p>Paula and Content slipped arms about each
other&#8217;s waists and wandered off between the box-bordered
flower-beds in the old garden. Of
late, they had found many things in common, of
likes and dislikes; and it had grown to be &#8220;the
girls,&#8221; whenever they were spoken of in the
household. Slowly ripening friendships are safest;
and that of the elder cousins had grown
gradually enough; but now it promised to equal
that of names famous in history.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I have done to vex Aunt Ruth!&#8221;
cried Paula, wistfully. &#8220;I never thought so
much about doing just right in my life as I have
done since grandmother went away; but the
harder I try the worse things appear to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done right, dear Paula; and Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Ruth will be the first to see she was mistaken in
laying any blame to you. She is so honest she
will tell you so, or else I am very much mistaken.
But what in the world Octave ever went
away like that for, and why she went, is just as
much a puzzle to me as ever. Aunt Ruth will
get the truth out of her, though, if it is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Octave would not tell
a lie to save herself any amount of blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I know that; but what the &#8216;Mystery&#8217;
is, and why there should be any &#8216;Mystery,&#8217;
is more than I see. Aunt Ruth will find out
what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s between Melville and Octave. One is as
deep in it as the other. And I have a suspicion,
but I don&#8217;t know what gave it to me, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A suspicion of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that he has thought of something,
or invented something that she went away to see
about. And that old gentleman who came home
with her is in the plot, too. I wonder who he
was! Not much of anybody, though, I fancy;
he was so very plain and quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, behind the closed door of Melville&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
room, Octave was undergoing a cross-examination
which tried her ardent soul to the
uttermost. Time and time again she was on the
point of giving out and divulging the &#8220;Mystery&#8221;;
but as often was she restrained by the thought of
the brilliant climax she hoped to achieve. She
had promptly dried her tears, and looked up
bravely into the kind, questioning face above her,
and Aunt Ruth thought she had never seen anything
sweeter than the frank young countenance
into which she looked back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Aunt Ruthy, it&#8217;s just this way.
People can hold their tongues even if they do
want to tell things, if they think that some good
is to be gained by it. Some great good is to be
gained by my keeping still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good to whom, Octave?&#8221; The aunt had
found a deeper perplexity, even, than she had
imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Melville first, and afterward for all of us.
Wouldn&#8217;t you be proud of him, if you should
suddenly find him the most famous boy of his
age, of this age, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee knows very well that I should be proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of him or of any one who does a noble thing.
Fame is not always nobility; nor is notoriety
fame. I should not want either thee or him to
do anything for the mere sake of making peoples&#8217;
tongues wag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Ruth, we&#8217;re all in a &#8216;mix-up,&#8217; as
Fritzy says. In the first place, I am going to tell
tales for once, so as to clear up that about the
&#8216;tantrum.&#8217; Or, will you, Melville? It isn&#8217;t fair
that you should think it was Paula.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was Paula, to begin with,&#8221; answered
Melville, angrily. &#8220;She has such a terrible weight
of care on her shoulders, that she must needs
come in here and go to upsetting my things &#8216;to
straighten them,&#8217; she says. She hasn&#8217;t the least
idea of what value they are; and she turned out
some of my papers that will cost me hours to do
over again; and they must be done, because I
promised the professor&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melville, take care!&#8221; warned Octave.</p>

<p>Ruth&#8217;s ear had caught the word. As she knew
but one professor with whom Melville had any
acquaintance, and as he was thousands of miles
away when last she had heard of him, her interest
was freshly aroused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;The professor? Has thee heard from him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have had three letters from him,&#8221;
proudly replied the invalid, quite thrown off his
guard. &#8220;I have put them away in the most
careful place, now; but it was one of those that
I thought Paula had destroyed, as well as my
&#8216;calculations.&#8217; Think of my having, really having
them written to <i>me</i>, too, three letters from a
man so famous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I did not know that the professor
was so great. He seemed to me a dreamer and
a rather insignificant person altogether. What
is he doing now?&#8221; asked Miss Kinsolving, with
her mind quite upon the wrong person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Aunt Ruth! You cannot read the
papers much! What is he not doing for science
and the world? Think of all the wonderful helps
to suffering people he has thought of in that one
brain of his! Oh, it&#8217;s grand, grand! And to
think that Mel&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave, take care!&#8221; warned the boy in his
turn, but with eyes shining from the enthusiasm
her words had aroused.</p>

<p>Ruth looked from one to the other, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
an expression so dismayed that Octave could not
refrain from laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Aunt Ruthy; but you do look so
bothered, and it is all so splendid, if you only
knew! Won&#8217;t you just step out into the other
room, and let me talk the thing over with Melville
for a minute? Then I can know just how
much to tell, and what I should not.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was certainly a novel proposition from a
girl to her guardian; but Octave&#8217;s earnestness
disarmed it of offence. All that Ruth did ejaculate
was a characteristic &#8220;Humph!&#8221; but the
tone in which it was uttered said volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Aunt Ruthy, it does seem dreadful
saucy, and all that; but I don&#8217;t see how I am to
help it. I am so sorry you came home; no&mdash;I
mean I&#8217;m glad, of course, for I love you; but if
you hadn&#8217;t come, it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been more convenient for
thee,&#8221; finished Miss Kinsolving, smiling in spite
of her determination to be stern; also, in spite of
her determination not to do anything of the kind,
obediently walking out into the hall and standing
there like a child in a game, while her companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
behind the door deliberate as to her further
mystification.</p>

<p>Certainly, the truth that earnestness bears its
own force was never more fully exemplified.
After a very brief consultation, the door was
opened and the lady invited to re&euml;nter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Aunt Ruth, there is nothing we can tell
you, except that which Rosetta tried to write. I
think that she meant this: Ten days ago I went
to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave! Alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, ma&#8217;am; who was there to go with
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the happiest errand of my life. I am the
proudest girl you ever saw; though I am, even
in this case, &#8216;only Octave.&#8217; Did you ever hear
of Professor Edric von Holsneck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the world has heard of him. What has
he to do with thee and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything. I went to New York to see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave Pickel!&#8221; cried Aunt Ruth, in her
amazement; and could say no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;Yes, and just as soon as he heard that my
name <i>was</i> Octave Pickel he welcomed me with
both hands, literally and figuratively.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth sank back in her chair and fanned herself
with a palm-leaf she had picked up from the
carpet. Her astonishment certainly made her
speechless, till she reflected that after all it was
not so strange. She had heard that the firm of
&#8220;Pickel &amp; Pickel&#8221; were Professor von Holsneck&#8217;s
German publishers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! thee knew him, then; that was different;
but I hope thee did not go uninvited, and
that thee will intrude thyself upon no one without
first consulting older persons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, aunt; I did not know him at all. I had
only heard of him, as you or anybody else has.
But I had to see him on business. It was a sort
of case of &#8216;Mahomet and the mountain.&#8217; The
mountain&mdash;that&#8217;s Melville&mdash;couldn&#8217;t go to
Mahomet, so I went down and commanded the
prophet to come to the mountain, and he came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madcap! Does thee mean to tell me that
that great man has been beneath this roof,&mdash;been
here in The Snuggery?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;Beneath this very roof, here in this very
Snuggery; sitting in that very chair where you
sit now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; gasped Miss Kinsolving; and in
such dismay as to send them all off again into a
fit of laughter, which on her part arose from
nervousness, but on the young folks&#8217;s from pure
delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Ruth, you are the only person
privileged to know that. In this benighted
household my blessed professor is known only as&mdash;<span class="smcap">He</span>!
<span class="smcap">He</span> is a part of a splendid Mystery,
which even you cannot be told, till the time is
ripe. We have told you already more than we
intended, and more than any one else is to know,
perhaps for several weeks. When it is all accomplished&#8221;&mdash;here
Octave smiled most encouragingly
upon Melville, who suddenly appeared to
turn pale&mdash;&#8220;everybody will congratulate everybody,
and everything will be so beautiful! Please,
Aunt Ruth, don&#8217;t tell Paula Pickel nor any of
the others what we have told you. Let them
just live on and wonder who <span class="smcap">He</span> is, and what
<span class="smcap">He</span> is or was doing here. And won&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
just be real nice to Paula? That girl has made
a martyr of herself to &#8216;duty&#8217; ever since you
have been away; and I should have been here to
look after my boy when she came in, then there
wouldn&#8217;t have been any &#8216;tantrum.&#8217; But &#8216;tantrums&#8217;
aren&#8217;t anything. They&#8217;re only a symptom
of&mdash;genius. That is what the great man&mdash;<span class="smcap">He</span>&mdash;called
your Melville. Oh, I tell you,
Ruth Kinsolving, this family is bound to be
known to fame; and all on account of this young
snapping-turtle here, that is as rightly named
Capers as I am Pickel. Content we call the
&#8216;lamb,&#8217; and when the capers are a little too spicy
we send her in to get the sauce spread over a
mild surface. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>The day following, when Ruth entered her
mother&#8217;s room again, that observant person
remarked that &#8220;the change has done thee a
great deal of good. I never saw thee looking
brighter in thy life, my daughter. That tells me
without asking that thee found everything as it
should be at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly have had a thorough &#8216;change,&#8217;
Mother Amy; and I have been considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
&#8216;stirred up.&#8217; But whether everything is as it
should be, that I am not prepared to say. I
was never so puzzled in my life; and I never
heard of such children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>are</i> good children, only a bit more
sprightly than common&#8221;; returned the grandmother,
fondly. &#8220;I shall be glad when thee
thinks it is best for me to go back to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth sighed profoundly. She was conscious
already of a sort of homesick feeling to be living
again amidst all that overflowing life which had
taken possession of The Snuggery and practically
driven her out of it.</p>

<p>Mother Amy looked up from her knitting once
more. &#8220;Thy brow is frowning, and thee looks
even more perplexed than when thee went away,
Ruth; but brighter and gayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother, it did do me good, I think;
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the children have not been doing anything
rash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doing! Rash! Mother Amy, think of the
most unlikely thing in the world, and then make
up thy mind that those children have done it.
Even then thee will be far short of the mark.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A &#8220;Mystery&#8221;</span> is not healthful for any one;
even when the secret originates in brains as
youthful as Octave&#8217;s; and though it did not
solve the problem for the household, yet the visit
of Miss Kinsolving had somewhat the effect of a
thunder-storm upon a murky atmosphere. Certainly,
after her few words of apology and approbation
to Paula, that painstaking girl felt too
happy to pay any further attention to the vagaries
of the &#8220;conspirators,&#8221; Melville and Octave;
Content had her thoughts drawn from it by the
arrival of fresh letters and parcels from Japan;
Christina was deep in some new volumes of old-time
fairy tales, which her aunt had substituted
for Luke&#8217;s story papers; and little Fritz lived
mostly out of doors.</p>

<p>So if the &#8220;Mystery&#8221; did not die, the interest
of those not immediately connected with it did
die; and The Snuggery, for several consecutive
days, appeared as the abode of perfect peacefulness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;There is somethin&#8217; boun&#8217; ter happen!&#8221; said
Rosetta to Abraham. &#8220;Whenever them young ones
is still a minute it&#8217;s &#8217;cause they&#8217;re a-hatchin&#8217;
out fresh monkey-shines. They hain&#8217;t any on
&#8217;em done nothin&#8217; out o&#8217; the beaten track this
week er more. Not since Miss Ruth was to
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I shouldn&#8217;t think ye&#8217;d hanker to hev
&#8217;em step off the &#8216;beaten track,&#8217; as ye tell about.
I&#8217;ve noticed that when they does step off they
mostly steps a good pace. There was Octavy,
now, who&#8217;d ever thort of a gal a-turnin&#8217; a hull
hay-riggin&#8217; over on top of her; but she done it
an&#8217; come out purty near as good as ever.
Reckon she is&mdash;jest as well as she was afore, an&#8217;
&#8217;pears ter be gettin&#8217; as plump as a pa&#8217;tridge.
But Pauly, she don&#8217;t never seem to get inter no
scrapes, like the rest on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; retorted Rosetta, drawing off the
yellow buttermilk for Abraham to carry away to
the pigs. &#8220;She got inter one the very fust night
she arriv&#8217;. She scairt the life clean out o&#8217; poor
Mis&#8217; Capers, but you seem ter fergit thet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t bed no chance ter fergit it, bein&#8217;s ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
keep talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout it. But don&#8217;t ye worry; this
here Sunday-meetin&#8217; sort of doin&#8217;s ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217;
ter last long enough ter hurt us. My! but that
buttermilk is rich!&#8221; And, wiping his lips on his
shirt-sleeve, the farmer walked away stywards.</p>

<p>It is rarely safe to prophesy evil. It seemed
as if the very mention of &#8220;scrapes&#8221; was enough,
in that household, to induce one.</p>

<p>All summer long the pigs, which were the pride
of Abraham&#8217;s heart, had been allowed to run
about in some fields, and get their living pretty
much as they would have done in a native state.
But haying was over, and the good man had
more time to devote to his &#8220;stawk&#8221; than he had
had during that busy season just past. It
appeared to him time to begin &#8220;fattenin&#8217;,&#8221; and
that very day he had driven the pigs into a nearby
enclosure, intending to shut them into their
pens at night and feed them there.</p>

<p>For that purpose he had collected all the
buttermilk Rosetta had to spare, and, walking
noiselessly along over the grass-grown path, he
raised the pail to the top of the high, board fence
above the trough and emptied the contents in
one mighty swish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Though his eyes had been diverted by the
gambols of some kittens in a tree, his feet had
&#8220;almost gone theirselves&#8221; over the familiar
way which led to the &#8220;fattening&#8221; quarters of
many pigs departed long since, and it was an
almost mechanical motion which had emptied
the pail.</p>

<p>There was nothing mechanical, however, about
the yells and shrieks which followed, nor in the
tremendous jump which Abraham&#8217;s long limbs
made backwards. The startled man stumbled
over a milking-stool which he had also brought
along, and landed beneath the kittens&#8217; tree with
a thud which sent them shying still farther
upwards.</p>

<p>Then two heads appeared over the sty-wall,
and two very red and angry faces gleamed from
amid a flood of thick and clinging buttermilk.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the jingo!&#8221; cried Luke, in the accents of
a story-paper hero. But his feelings were not at
all story-paper-like, nor his further language that
which would have been most approved.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name of apple-sass be ye a-doin&#8217;
thar?&#8221; demanded Abraham, as soon as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
picked himself up, and recognized the drenched
persons as Luke and little Fritz.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t ye mind yer own business?&#8221;
retorted the angry Luke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was. I was a-feedin&#8217; the pigs&mdash;an&#8217; if so
be that ye belongs amongst &#8217;em, all right. Ye&#8217;ve
had yer supper.&#8221; And chuckling quietly to himself,
the busy man stalked off, leaving his victims
to recover their tempers and their cleanliness
at their leisure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest as I was a tellin&#8217; ye, Rosetty, ye needn&#8217;t
ha&#8217; worrited. Some kinks was a-boun&#8217; ter happen.
Thar was that lazy houn&#8217;, Luke, a settin&#8217;
in the pig-sty, an&#8217; Fritzy alongside on him. I
doused &#8217;em both with buttermilk, an&#8217; on your
&#8217;count I&#8217;m sorry, &#8217;cause I s&#8217;pose ye&#8217;ll hev the
youngun ter clean. But I ain&#8217;t sorry noways
elst. I s&#8217;picioned that boy of mine was a readin&#8217;
them air yarns ter Fritzy, &#8217;cause the little chap
he&#8217;s full of the oddest kind o&#8217; sayin&#8217;s ye ever
heerd; an&#8217; now I&#8217;ve kotched him. You lay it
down, Luke Tewkskury won&#8217;t git no great chanst
in the futur&#8217; ter waste Mis&#8217; Kinsolving&#8217;s time a
readin&#8217; trash, not whilst I&#8217;m his daddy! If he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
wants ter be sentimental, I&#8217;ll gin him a chanst
ter be, a-plowin&#8217; that ten-acre lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all quite true, as Abraham had surmised.
The disused pig-sty, shady and grass-grown,
had formed a capital and unsuspected
hiding-place for the fiction-loving Luke to while
away an hour of time, nor did he know that it
was so soon to be occupied by its natural tenants;
and after Christina&#8217;s refusal to read any more of
his exciting tales, he had turned to Fritz for sympathy,
filling that youngster&#8217;s mind with the
strangest muddle of stuff which ever floated
through a little brain.</p>

<p>Fortunately, but a fraction of all he heard
was comprehended, and a smaller fraction yet it
was which remained to puzzle and excite the
always excitable and, till now, carefully reared
child.</p>

<p>A tiny seed of evil stayed,&mdash;so small that no
one would have dreamed it could ever have
worked him ill. It was the idea of &#8220;ghosts.&#8221;
Not ghosts as they are usually considered, nor at
all as they appeared to the impressible soul of
Luke. A &#8220;ghost,&#8221; young Tewksbury would no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
sooner have tackled than a regiment of soldiers,
and his own predilection was for &#8220;burglars.&#8221;
Had he known it, &#8220;ghosts&#8221; and &#8220;burglars&#8221;
meant, to Fritz, one and the same thing; and
both he and his instructor longed for a chance to
show their prowess and &#8220;have a fight with one.&#8221;
Luke felt himself a hero of the deepest dye, and
what Fritz thought of his own capacity to meet
any and every emergency can be imagined.</p>

<p>Both were to have an opportunity of proving
their own merits, and it came speedily on the
heels of that buttermilk episode.</p>

<p>Luke slept in the house, though his father
lodged at their own cottage, some little distance
away. Sometimes Fritz was allowed to share
Luke&#8217;s pleasant apartment, especially when there
was a hunting trip in contemplation; for, young
as he was, it had been one of Uncle Fritz&#8217;s
requests that the little boy should be allowed the
use of fire-arms, believing, it may be wisely, that
if one is early trained to them, there is less danger
of accident than when left to find out their
use by lonely experiment. Luke was a &#8220;crack
shot,&#8221; and game on the mountain was abundant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Fritz had already won a fair record,&mdash;for &#8220;going
on nine,&#8221;&mdash;and he was ambitious of further
achievements.</p>

<p>The lads, big and little, went to bed, and soon
to sleep; Fritz&#8217;s small rifle and Luke&#8217;s pistol
lying ready at hand against an early waking.
But visions of white, drenching floods, burglars,
and ghosts mingled with little Fritz&#8217;s dreams;
induced in great measure by an unusually bountiful
supper which Rosetta had given him as a
consolation for his accident, and partly by their
having sat up quite late to finish a most thrilling
tale and to taste of a lunch which had been put
up for their out-of-door breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we eat it over-night, we&#8217;ll make sure of
it,&#8221; said Luke, facetiously. He was always hungry,
and Fritz was not to be outdone in that or
any other matter by any big boy living. So he
ate as long as he could, and then he dreamed as
fast as he could; and in the midst of both, it
always afterwards seemed to him, he had sat up
in bed and seen Luke at the window, looking out
with a very mysterious air.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Lukey?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;Whis-st! Bu-ur-gla-rs!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz could almost hear Luke&#8217;s teeth chatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cracky! I bet he&#8217;s afraid! Abry-ham said
he would be, if a real one came to town. I
ain&#8217;t, though. I&#8217;m a gentleman. Gentlemen
ain&#8217;t never afraid of nothin&#8217;. Pooh! I&#8217;ll show
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Creeping so softly out of bed in his bare feet
that his companion did not hear him, he seized
his little rifle and cautiously crept to the other
open window.</p>

<p>On the grass below, a white figure was moving
slowly about, in a vague sort of fashion, which,
had either protector of the defenceless been
wiser, he would have known belonged neither to
any burglar nor ghost which ever troubled the
repose of the peaceful.</p>

<p>Luke&#8217;s own weapon was poised, but he was so
nervous and intensely excited that he delayed to
fire; else would the tragedy have been great.
But while he paused to steady himself, crack
went the other rifle, and down dropped the
&#8220;ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then and there arose such shrieks and screams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
as no burglar or disembodied spirit ever uttered,
and which drove Luke in despair to hide his
head beneath the bed-clothes, and Fritz to stand
and gaze with rueful, half-dazed wonder upon
one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;a whole yard full of ghosts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritzy&#8217;s</span> face showed traces of recent tears,
but his valiant air not even tears could subdue.
He stood by Dr. Winslow&#8217;s side, affectionately
resting one arm across the gentleman&#8217;s shoulder,
and with the other surreptitiously wiping his
besmeared and stubby little nose.</p>

<p>The doctor tried to look grave, but the effort
resulted only in a mixed expression of fun and
seriousness. To his mind, small Fritzy was a
&#8220;delicious child,&#8221; infinitely diverting after the
many grave cares which weighed upon the heart
of the country physician, to whom each patient
was like an old friend, therefore to be worried
over beyond a mere professional interest in an
unknown patient.</p>

<p>The doctor was always glad of an excuse to
stop at The Snuggery; but he had been exceedingly
anxious that night, when he had been summoned
thither.</p>

<p>&#8220;Luke and Fritz have been shooting folks,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
was the breathless message Octave delivered,
having run all the way between houses to give it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shooting folks, Miss Octave! What in the
name of common-sense!&#8221; and the kind face had
worn an expression of terrible dismay. &#8220;Shooting
whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nobody but Paula; I don&#8217;t believe they
hurt her, either, but she doesn&#8217;t seem just right
or she won&#8217;t talk, and&mdash;and&mdash;you&#8217;ll come right
away, quick, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once. Fortunately, the brown mare is
already harnessed, for I had but just come in,
and had let her stand to cool off. Jump in with
me, and tell me on the way all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave promptly obeyed, and her tongue flew
fast for a few seconds. When she had finished,
the doctor asked, &#8220;Has any one been really
wounded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe so; though Rosetta declares
that Paula must be, somewhere. I think she is
terribly frightened, and it has made her faint.
Who wouldn&#8217;t be that, to be shot at by a couple
of boys, just because you were walking in your
sleep!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;Who, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed the physician,
sympathetically, and drove the faster.</p>

<p>From which it was evident that the burglar-ghost
had been only poor Paula, taking one of
her nocturnal, somnambulistic exercises; and that
when Octave had missed her sister from their
room, she had set out in pursuit of her. Likewise
had little Christina, who, lying awake on her
own small bed, had seen Paula pass the door, and
had sleepily murmured, &#8220;She&#8217;s walking again,
and I must get up and follow her.&#8221; Likewise
Content, who had learned the family habit of
care over the unfortunate victim of somnambulism.
Ditto Rosetta, whose burdened soul had
never known peaceful rest since the Kinsolvings
went away and left the &#8220;pickles&#8221; in her charge.</p>

<p>No wonder that Fritz had seen a &#8220;whole yard
full of ghosts&#8221;; for none of the pursuers had
stopped to cover their white night-robes with
anything less gleaming; and no wonder that each
and every female throat had emitted the shrillest
scream of which it was capable, on receiving an
attack from fire-arms.</p>

<p>But &#8220;all is well that ends well,&#8221; and when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
doctor had duly examined each &#8220;spook&#8221; separately,
he found nothing more serious than a very
bad fright to all, with a faintness on Paula&#8217;s part,
which was easily accounted for by the shock of
her sudden awaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure to goodness she is hit some&#8217;eres,
though,&#8221; declared Rosetta, even in the face of
professional assurance to the contrary. &#8220;That
little boy has shot more things &#8217;an ye could shake
a stick at; he&#8217;s allays a pepperin&#8217; sunthin&#8217;; only
day afore yisterday he aimed to kill a chipmonk
an&#8217; hit my Plymouth rooster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense, Rosetta! That ought to
prove to you that he didn&#8217;t hit Paula&mdash;since he
deliberately aimed at her. Anyway, he only
shot a hole through her very best night-dress,
which she had no business to be wearing every
day, and served her right,&#8221; cried Octave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this so, Fritzy?&#8221; asked the doctor, despairing
of convincing Rosetta that things were
not so terrible after all. &#8220;Do you practise shooting
at that rate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m kind of out of practice now, but I
used to hit a tack, a carpet tack, forty feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
away,&#8221; answered the boy, with boastful assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! That was doing well,&#8221; exclaimed
the amused physician.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy pulled out a small pistol,
and before the doctor quite comprehended what
he was after, aimed at the opposite door and
fired. The bullet missed its mark, but Fritz
walked across to the casement, and examined it
with interest. &#8220;See? See there? That&#8217;s where
she went through!&#8221; The grubby little forefinger
traced a diminutive crack at the point where
he fancied the bullet had vanished. &#8220;Must ha&#8217;
gone clear through!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it went &#8216;clear though&#8217;&mdash;the open
window; but, Fritz, I hope you are not in the
habit of carrying fire-arms. It is a very dangerous
thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never did carry &#8217;em, and I guess I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t begin now; though they ain&#8217;t any danger.
Pooh! It scares Rosetta &#8217;most into fits jest to see
a fire-arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aged air of experience, and the manly
contempt for feminine weakness was so amusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to the doctor that he felt repaid for his night&#8217;s
trouble, just to have witnessed it. However,
he decided to improve the opportunity by exercising
the authority which Mrs. Kinsolving had
placed in his hands when she left the Pickels for
her sea-side sojourn. He had not used it theretofore,
believing that undue restriction would
only set the active young brains of his charges
to inventing new and possibly more hazardous
amusements than any of which he had heard;
but the unrestrained use of rifles and pistols&mdash;that
must be suppressed at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come near doing great harm by
your carelessness, little Fritz; and, as a reminder
of it, I think I shall have to forbid your using
your weapons any more, until some of your
relatives return. I am sorry, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you do it, then?&#8221; demanded
Fritz, coolly interrupting what he foresaw would
be a long lecture. If he had to be punished, he
liked to be at once, and have done with it. He
didn&#8217;t like long-drawn ceremonies of any sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the good of the world at large,&#8221;
answered the physician; &#8220;now you skip to bed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and I would advise that you sleep in your own
apartment. I don&#8217;t think Luke is the best intimate
you could have found.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mention of Luke brought the full force of
the doctor&#8217;s punishment to mind. &#8220;You mean&mdash;you
mean I can&#8217;t go hunting woodchucks to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a woodchuck,&#8221; laughed the doctor;
but Fritz saw that the laugh covered a firm decision.
His face fell as it had not done, even
when bathed in tears over his possible wounding
of his sister. Girls, in Fritz&#8217;s estimation, were as
plenty and about as valuable as blackberries;
but&mdash;woodchucks! The tears with which he
burrowed his curly head into his pillow five
minutes later were bitter indeed.</p>

<p>Having convinced himself that nobody had
suffered real damage, and having given Paula a
simple restorative for her startled nerves, the
weary physician rode away, and left the household
at The Snuggery to get what rest it could.</p>

<p>But Octave could not sleep. There was that
upon her mind which prevented. Yet this
unusual state of things was not occasioned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
any anxiety about Paula, or that evening&#8217;s experience.
Finally, to lie still became impossible,
and, rising, she wrapped herself in the counterpane
from the bed she now enjoyed alone,
since Paula, at the doctor&#8217;s suggestion, had been
promoted to the honor of occupying &#8220;grandmother&#8217;s
room.&#8221; There she could sleep undisturbed
as late as nature craved the rest. &#8220;After
a good sleep she will be as fresh as new,&#8221; the
doctor had told them.</p>

<p>So, in her lonely chamber, by the light of one
candle, Octave prepared to unburden herself of
her great &#8220;Mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fingers trembled so that she could hardly
write, and her heart-beats were so loud she fancied
that all the family must hear them. She began,
without prelude, other than the conventional
&#8220;Dear Aunt Ruth&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The great surgeon is to come here to-morrow. I didn&#8217;t know
it till to-day, but he has been unexpectedly called back to Germany,
and if he doesn&#8217;t come now, Melville&#8217;s chance is gone
forever. Perhaps it is as well so as any way, though I did want
to have time to prepare your mind a little, for you do worry so.</p>

<p>And all this dreadful night, when Fritzy has been shooting
Paula, there has lain poor Melville alone, and contemplating&mdash;to-morrow!
I&#8217;ve been with him as much as I could without making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Rosetta ask questions; but it was hard to manage. Of course, I
couldn&#8217;t go in there without putting my dress on, and as fast as I
would get it on Rosetta would come in and say, &#8220;Go to bed,
deary. You can&#8217;t do a mite o&#8217; good,&#8221; in that motherly way of
hers, till I thought I should just fly. Then, when I did get a
chance to slip in to him, Melville would upbraid me for having no
heart. I begged of him to let me tell the rest of the folks, but he
wouldn&#8217;t, not till morning, for he says, and I should say the same,
that he couldn&#8217;t bear to have them talk about it, as they would
be sure to; who, indeed, could help it?</p>

<p>Dear me! I&#8217;m as bad as Rosetta, about punctuation and all
that. But I am so excited, I don&#8217;t know which end my head is
on; of course that is unladylike to say, but you know what I
mean. The surgeon is coming at ten o&#8217;clock. He is going to
bring his own assistants with him. He hopes for it to be a success;
because, when that young man came up and made the
examination, he agreed with Fritzy Nunky, that Melville could
be helped; that he was not really incurable, but it would only be
by one operation and that a severe one. Fritzy Nunky is at the
bottom of it; and I am in the middle; but Melville is at the top.
You see it is he that has to suffer, either being a cripple all his
life, or having something or other cut, which will let him walk
some time, after he has learned how. Uncle says he will have to
learn just as a baby does; but won&#8217;t I just be willing to teach
him!</p>

<p>That boy really has developed wonderfully, during the time he
has been under my supervision. And he is behaving like a little
hero, this very minute. Then the best part of it is that he is to be
famous and heroic all at one and the same time. The last
letter he had from Professor von Holsneck he said that every
experiment but one had been successful. The professor is most
enthusiastic; and I am so proud, because it was I who introduced
him to the family. Of course, if anything goes wrong, I shall
telegraph; but if you don&#8217;t hear from me in that way, you will
know that the operation is a success.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t write any more now, for my candle has burned out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
I have it &#8220;borne in on me&#8221; that I should go to Melville. Oh, I
forgot. I haven&#8217;t told you but half the &#8220;Mystery&#8221; yet; but you
will have to wait, for there goes the candle!</p>
</div>

<p>The letter had no signature; and it needed
none. No one save Octave could have written
it.</p>

<p>But by the same mail which carried it another
was sent. This, composed by Content, had something
more of lucidity, if also more that was
startling.</p>

<p>The letter tells the story of what had been
going on at The Snuggery better than it could
otherwise be told.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Ruth</span>:</p>

<p>This morning, at ten o&#8217;clock, a carriage drove up to our gate
and out of it there stepped three gentlemen. Octave had just
frightened us all nearly to death by telling us that Melville was
this morning to undergo an operation to see if his limbs could
not be straightened. The operation was considered a simple one,
though it is comparatively a new one; and only one German
surgeon has as yet performed it successfully. That surgeon is a
friend of Mr. Pickel; and &#8220;Uncle Fritz&#8221; persuaded him to come
up here and operate on Melville. This was at Melville&#8217;s own
request, and it was something which could be done here as well as
in a hospital.</p>

<p>There was a trained woman nurse, and one of the three men is
also a trained nurse, and he is to stay here until Melville is quite
well again. The others were doctors, and Dr. Winslow was here
with another physician from the village. Octave stayed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
room all the time; and the only sign she showed of being frightened
was when they called for Rosetta&#8217;s long ironing-table, and
carried that into Melville&#8217;s sitting-room. She turned so white
then that I thought she would faint, and I ran to her; but she put
me away at once. &#8220;Don&#8217;t! I am all right!&#8221; she said; and she
seemed to be, but I couldn&#8217;t have done it. As for Paula, she is
in bed recovering from her shot-at episode. Christina has taken
Fritz and gone away into the woods, and Rosetta is crying in the
kitchen, or she was the last time I saw her.</p>

<p>This is part of the great MYSTERY which Melville and Octave
have had; and it has all turned out splendidly. The operation is,
as far as they can judge, a perfect success; and words cannot tell
you how glad Melville is; but I don&#8217;t believe he is half as glad as
Octave. That girl just beams! They didn&#8217;t tell you on account
of grandma; and even Mr. Pickel didn&#8217;t know when it was to
be, though he has written heaps of letters and arranged everything
as far as he could, being absent.</p>

<p>The other part, the Professor von Holsneck part is, as far as I
understand it, like this: Melville has always been fond of messing
with chemicals and weeds and things on that queer invalid table
of his. All his experiments have had but one end in view; and
that one such as a boy who has suffered so much would value the
most. He wanted to cure pain. If he could not cure it, at least
to ease it; and he has accomplished the most wonderful thing!</p>

<p>But, there is Octave calling. I do hope that nothing has happened!
Luke is just going to the village, so I will send this right
along, and write some more to-morrow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Letters</span> for me? That is good,&#8221; said Ruth
Kinsolving, as the pleasant-faced servant brought
in the morning mail. &#8220;Home letters, too,
Mother Amy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandmother Kinsolving smiled. She had
learned to watch her daughter&#8217;s face with considerable
amusement, whenever missives from the
&#8220;pickle&#8221;-invaded Snuggery were received.
There was always something in them to disquiet
the order-loving little lady herself, but the real
burden of anxiety was felt by Ruth.</p>

<p>Even when events appeared to the young folks
in the old house to have been running with wonderful
smoothness, these absent home-makers
found cause for perplexity. Of late, however,
there had been a dearth of &#8220;happenings&#8221;; and
the soul of Ruth had something akin to that of
Rosetta, in that she prophesied evil from this
quietude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dread to open them, mother. It is impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
but that something out of common has
occurred by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read away, daughter. Thee had been growing
wiser, I fancied; certainly, ever since thy
visit home, thee has seemed less disturbed.
But, read away! I am the one who is impatient
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth prepared to comply, but an interruption
occurred in the shape of a visit from an invited
guest; and the fateful epistles of Content and
Octave were laid aside for a more convenient
hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be nothing in them that will not
keep,&#8221; said Ruth to herself, as she helped the
guest to lay aside her wraps, and to make herself
comfortable for the day.</p>

<p>The visitor was an old friend of Amy Kinsolving&#8217;s
youth; and there was something so pretty
in the meeting of the old ladies that Ruth utterly
forgot all other interests for the next few hours.
Then, before the &#8220;convenient&#8221; one arrived,
another guest appeared; and that one no other
than Uncle Fritz himself.</p>

<p>To say that his unexpected arrival set everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
in commotion is to say only what would
have been surmised by those who knew him
best. But the commotion was still a happy one,
and, if he knew anything of what Octave and
Content had vainly tried to communicate, he did
not mention it. Indeed, to Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s
inquiry as to when he had heard from
the children he replied: &#8220;Oh, I have but just
come from there, I made them a flying visit first,
then hurried right away here. I did not know
I could get off so soon, though it has indeed
seemed long to me since I looked upon your
face, dear madam&#8221;; and the genial gentleman
bowed over Mother Amy&#8217;s hand with a grace
which won upon her heart, opposed even as it
had always been to ceremonies.</p>

<p>After awhile it became evident to Aunt Ruth
that Mr. Pickel had something which he particularly
wished to say to her; and so, leaving her
mother to enjoy her friend, the pretty Quakeress
tied on her stiff bonnet and led him away to her
favorite spot by the sea-shore. But, from the
expression of his countenance, anxious perhaps,
though not at all distressed, it did not appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
that he had come to be the bearer of ill tidings;
and as his confidence had nothing especial in
connection with the events then enacting at
The Snuggery, it need not be speculated upon
here.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that this confidence delayed
the two&mdash;and so unlike&mdash;guardians of &#8220;a jar
of pickles&#8221; for such an unheard of length of time,
that Mother Amy finally grew anxious, and dispatched
the pleasant-faced servant to hunt the
delinquents up.</p>

<p>They came in, at last, looking so at peace with
themselves and all the world that Mrs. Kinsolving&#8217;s
own face brightened; though she opened
her conversation with the gentle remonstrance:
&#8220;I was sorry thee did not come in time to see
friend Barbara off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mother Amy! That is too bad! Thee
must forgive my inattention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing, of course; there was no especial
reason why thee should have come, but I
think she would have liked to speak with thee
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth glanced at Uncle Fritz, and said nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
What could she say, since till that moment she
had quite forgotten the existence of friend Barbara
Fletcher?</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz seemed, also, strangely unmindful
of people&#8217;s prejudices, for he sauntered to the
window, whistling the very gayest and most
worldly of operatic airs. Amy Kinsolving looked
anxiously toward her daughter, fearing she would
reprimand the gentleman for his lack of taste;
but she need not have feared, though Ruth&#8217;s
fearless tongue had corrected more than one
such offence, swift on its commission.</p>

<p>Since Ruth did not object, and seemed, indeed,
to be lost in some happy thoughts of her own,
Grandmother Amy softly sighed in her relief.
Aloud she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I need not ask thee if the children are doing
as they should. I see by thy face that there is
nothing amiss; but, if Fritz does not object, I
should like to hear thee read the home letters
now, daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The letters?&#8221; asked Ruth. She had forgotten
them along with Barbara Fletcher! Again
she shot that funny glance of hers &#8220;Fritzy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Nunky&#8217;s&#8221; way, and this time a very pretty pinkish
color crept up into her cheeks. &#8220;Mother!
thee will think I am a heartless girl; but I had
forgotten the letters, too. I have not read them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not think thee heartless&mdash;but please
to read them now,&#8221; answered Mother Amy, with
a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>And with her cheeks brighter than ever, Ruth
opened the two letters. &#8220;I&#8217;ll glance through
them first, mother; thee knows I like to do
so.&#8221; For this aunt of many tribulations had
learned that there were some happenings which
even her honest tongue would best withhold
from the gentle old mistress of The Snuggery.
If she had told Mother Amy quite all that went
on in her beloved home, perhaps her recovery
would not have been as rapid or as thorough as
it had been.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kinsolving and Uncle Fritz fell into conversation,
while Ruth extracted the sting, as it
were, from the home letters before she shared
them with the others. But, after awhile, it
seemed even to these two patient souls as if this
proceeding was one of infinite labor and thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
judging from the time it consumed; and they
turned from the window through which they had
been watching the play of some little ones upon
the lawn, to inquire the reason.</p>

<p>Then, with a cry of alarm, they each sprang
forward, as Ruth, for almost the first time in
her life, nearly succumbed to the weakness of
fainting.</p>

<p>Nearly, but not quite. The terrified look in
her mother&#8217;s eyes, and Uncle Fritz&#8217;s sustaining
clasp recalled her fleeing senses. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d like
a drink of&mdash;water!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had it on the instant, and, after she had
drunken part of it, her color came back and she
was able to speak quite firmly. &#8220;It is about as
bad as it can be, but lest thee should think it
worse than it is, I will try to read them. Fritz,
thee should have told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she resolutely took hold of the closely
written sheets, and, disdaining all Mr. Pickel&#8217;s
offers of assistance, read them through to the
end. Those who were familiar with the varying
tones of Ruth Kinsolving&#8217;s voice would have
judged from it then that she was very deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
moved. Even Uncle Fritz, who should have
been so much a stranger, understood it; and had
Melville heard her he would certainly have said,
&#8220;Aunt Ruth means business!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Mother Amy was almost as much disturbed
by the tidings which were so ambiguously
conveyed through Octave&#8217;s and Content&#8217;s stories
as her daughter had been; but she was the first
to recover her scattered wits. &#8220;Then, since no
telegram has come, it must have all turned out
for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has, dear madam; it has, indeed!&#8221; cried
Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best, Mother Amy! Can thee see any
&#8216;best&#8217; even in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, my child. It is best for Melville
to have had this chance, this Providential blessing;
and it is as well that it should all have been
gone through with without thy knowledge. Thee
would have worried thyself ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Ruth; replying to her mother
as she had rarely before replied.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Uncle Fritz. &#8220;And so thee
has known this all along, and did not tell me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>Poor Fritzy Nunky almost shivered in his
shoes; but, being of the same valiant stuff as his
small nephew, he rallied to the occasion. &#8220;Yes,
sweetheart, I knew. But I would not have had
thee know it for a fortune, till it was done and
safely done.&#8221; At which remarkable speech
Mother Amy opened her eyes most widely,
though Ruth dropped hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said that young person at last, and
after a rather uncomfortable silence; &#8220;since
every inconceivable thing has happened which
could happen, I suppose there is no objection to
my going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the least in the world,&#8221; answered Uncle
Fritz, generously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it is high time we went. Thee had
best go and pack up, my daughter, while I have
a word or two with Fritz, here. We will go
home, or start for home to-night, by the evening
boat.&#8221; Grandmother Kinsolving&#8217;s tone had
that ring of authority she so rarely exercised,
but which there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>Ruth gave her mother one glance, then
stooped and kissed the fair old cheek before she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
hurried from the room. But again the stalwart
Fritz had fallen to trembling; and that before
the gentlest of little women, in the meek garb of
a Friend, whose question might mean much or
little, according to the hearer&#8217;s mood: &#8220;Well,
Fritz?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> trained nurse had gone out of the room,
leaving Octave in charge of the patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are patient and the patient, both, dear
Melville,&#8221; said the girl, affectionately laying her
warm hand on the lad&#8217;s thin one. &#8220;You are a
hero! I&#8217;ve been wanting to say it ever since&mdash;three
days ago; but that ever-watchful nurse
hasn&#8217;t given me a chance. I&#8217;m as proud of you
as proud!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville smiled. &#8220;I am not much of a hero,
dear; but I ought to be patient. Indeed, there
doesn&#8217;t seem to be any need for that virtue now.
Only think, in a very few weeks the surgeon said
I could begin to try my limbs. Think! when
I&#8217;ve lain here so many years, without the shadow
of a hope that I should ever be any better! A
fellow ought to be willing to bear anything for
such a gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Octave&#8217;s eyes filled. It had, strangely enough,
never seemed half so pitiful to her that Melville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
should be a cripple till this possibility of his cure
arose to cheer them on. &#8220;Laddie, if it had been
me, I should have been perfectly horrid. I&mdash;I
think I should have had to be shut up in a
cage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You would have been just the
same happy, cheering-up body that you are
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! don&#8217;t be silly. I never did like flattery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, it isn&#8217;t flattery, Octave. You don&#8217;t
know how much you have done for me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, beg pardon; I have laughed at you
and scolded you and tormented you into doing
things till you hated me and everybody. But,
my son, I did it for your good. That is what
the grown-up people remark when they are especially
disagreeable. And isn&#8217;t it splendid? That
great doctor says he can cure Paula Pickel of
traipsing around as a spook, at all hours of the
night. He says he considers it only a nervous
disorder, and that a prescription he gave me will
help her. I told him about her while he was
waiting to have Rosetta make him a cup of coffee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
that other day, after&mdash;after he&#8217;d fixed you up.
I thought I&#8217;d make a clean business of everything,
and get everybody patched up who needed
mending. One I forgot, though. That was
Luke. He declares that he has something the
matter with his arms which keeps him from doing
certain things he ought to do. He&mdash;Lukey
Tewky&mdash;called me aside and asked me: &#8216;What
did he say about me?&#8217; &#8216;Say about you! He
did not even dream of your existence,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;Oh! do tell him about my arms, won&#8217;t you?&#8217;
and just then along came Abry-ham, and he
caught hold of his son and shook him so that if
anything ailed him it was shaken out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville laughed as gaily as his entertainer
desired, at this picture of the farmer and his son.
&#8220;Keep his spirits up,&#8221; the great surgeon had
bidden her; &#8220;there is more healing in an unaffected
laugh than in the whole <i>materia medica</i>.&#8221;
Which statement the wise man may not have
intended to be taken as literally as Octave took
it. However, it was certain that the girl who
had devoted herself so unselfishly to her crippled
cousin did him more good than any other companion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
and Melville would have had her in his
sick-room all the time had he been allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the discovery; that is part
mine, you know, if the surgeon part does belong
to Fritzy Nunky. Nobody but just Octave would
ever have dared to go and see such a wonderful
creature as my dear old professor has turned out
to be. I don&#8217;t think <i>I</i> would dare do it again,
after all Aunt Ruth&#8217;s remarks about the boldness
of it. I suppose it was dreadful, but I am awfully
glad I did it, all the same. Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Octave, it is almost too splendid to be
true. Read this letter.&#8221; The sick boy drew
out from under his pillow a brief note from the
great scientist, whose every written word had so
genuine a value. If brief, it was also enthusiastic.
The writer had seen the famous specialist,
Dr. Karl Ettm&uuml;ller, had learned that not only
was the operation eminently successful but that
the an&aelig;sthetic of Melville&#8217;s discovery had been
thoroughly and happily tested first in Melville&#8217;s
own case. He wrote to congratulate: &#8220;He who
has reduced the burden of physical agony is a
philanthropist, and he who discovers one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
God&#8217;s own cures is a genius. My lad, I hold
you to be both; and when you shall be physically
able, I ask you to come and take a position in
my laboratory. It will give the old man new
vigor to feel that such an one as you is beside
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Melville! Is it true? Is it really true? I
shall have to pinch myself to make myself
believe it.&#8221; Octave&#8217;s eyes were shining, and her
cheeks glowed with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, it must be, true, Octave; since here it is
in black and white. I have to take it out from
under my pillow a dozen times a day to read it
over, since I haven&#8217;t your felicitous method of
convincing myself. Octave, I&#8217;d rather have that
letter, that offer, than all the money in the
world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I!&#8221; cried the girl, responsively;
then paused to purse up her merry lips in a
doubtful fashion. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,
though, laddie; all the money in all the world
would be a &#8216;purty consid&#8217;able of a pile,&#8217; as
Abry-ham would say. One could do a heap of
good with all that money.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be disagreeable, Octave. It is
splendid, and you can&#8217;t deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wishes to? See here, my friend, you
may be a hero now, as I remarked a few minutes
since, but you are not yet an angel. You are
still quite&mdash;Capersy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Melville laughed. &#8220;I do not pose either as a
hero or an angel; it is yourself who gives me the
attributes of such. I only aspire&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless the lad! Don&#8217;t begin to talk too
booksy, just because you are a genius-philanthropist!
But we did have a Mystery! Even
Aunt Ruth will have to admit that; and we did
keep it all to our two selves, with a few necessary
others like Fritzy Nunky and the specialist and
the scientist and the attendants, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the mutual-congratulation meeting was
speedily broken up. Outside the house a strange
uproar had arisen. Don brayed; Rosetta cried:
&#8220;To goodness knows!&#8221; Fritzy set up a shout
that could have been heard a long distance;
Abraham gave the peculiar whistle that with him
indicated intense and pleased surprise; doors
slammed, even the well-trained doors of The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Snuggery, which had missed Aunt Ruth&#8217;s frequent
&#8220;oily feather&#8221;; feet sounded in a rush
over the gravel walks. But none of these
unwonted if joyful sounds could drown the cheery
rumble of wheels, nor the &#8220;Hoa! halloa!&#8221;
which only one hearty German throat could
give.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritzy Nunky! Fritzy Nunky!&#8221; shouted
Octave, and started to run away.</p>

<p>Suddenly something stayed her speeding feet.
Three months ago the something would have
had no effect; but now she stopped, and going
back to the bed-side sat down and laid her hand
again on that of Melville.</p>

<p>Weak and shaken yet, by the ordeal he had so
lately and so manfully passed through, he could
not subdue the tremor which seized him at
sound of the well-known voice. Unspeakable
thoughts of pride and humility, affection and
loneliness, stole through the invalid&#8217;s mind. After
all his achievements, after all his endurance&mdash;he
was still alone. Aunt Ruth had her mother, the
Pickels had their beloved guardian, but he&mdash;had
only a memory of a love which had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
failed him, but which he had despised till it
was lost. &#8220;Genius&#8221; and &#8220;philanthropist&#8221; others
might call him; but at that moment of others&#8217;
reunion, Melville remembered only that he was a
sick and orphaned lad.</p>

<p>Then he felt the touch of sympathy upon
his hand, and brought round his eyes from the
wall where he had turned them to Octave&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go and meet your uncle?&#8221;
he asked, pettishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I would rather stay here,&#8221; answered
Octave, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t make a martyr of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor you a bear of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you went. I don&#8217;t mind being
left alone. I&#8217;m used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a&mdash;a fib; two fibs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told one, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, I told the truth; I want to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then when he comes in, if he should come
in, he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you mind seeing him now, since
you have seen him once since&mdash;hush! he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
coming in now; so is Aunt Ruth; so is grandmother;
so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my precious lambs! So I have found
you together,&#8221; said the sweet voice of Amy
Kinsolving. &#8220;They have all told me what thee
has done for Melville, little Octave. I knew thee
had a good heart, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, together; and at our old occupation,&mdash;quarrelling,&#8221;
replied Octave, so demurely that
everybody laughed, and any dangerous flood of
sentiment was happily averted.</p>

<p>Then, how the tongues flew! How gay and
how glad was everybody! And, how the silliest
little speeches made everybody smile, only those
who have been parted and happily reunited can
fancy.</p>

<p>After grandmother had been put into Melville&#8217;s
easiest corner on the old lounge, which he
boasted he had vacated forever, the &#8220;Mystery&#8221;
was taken out of its hiding-place, and all that
had been dimly understood made plain. The
project of the surgeon&#8217;s visit, and the project of
the an&aelig;sthetic being tested by its discoverer in
his own proper person, before he let it be on any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
other human being&mdash;that was what the &#8220;Mystery&#8221;
resolved itself into, when all was said and
done.</p>

<p>But the greatest events of the world&#8217;s history
may be told in a few words; why, then, not
these? Though the far-reaching effects of those
events neither words which have been nor words
which shall be said can ever half depict. So
thought these loving hearts, it may be, under
God&#8217;s blessing, with Melville&#8217;s discovery; a discovery
he had doubtless never made had he not
been laid upon a bed of physical helplessness,
and left to observe and make his world out of the
trivial happenings which went on before his one
window. And the wisest know that in the wonderful
economy of nature there is nothing trivial
or beneath their notice.</p>

<p>A peaceful quietude fell on them all for a little
while, and no one cared to speak or mar it.
Grandmother Amy&#8217;s face took on that look it
always wore when her soul was moved by the
Spirit. She was far away, just then, from her
material surroundings, in that higher world which
seemed to those who loved and watched her as
her native air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>The silence might have continued much longer
had not little Fritz been suddenly moved to
&#8220;speak in meeting.&#8221; He was opposed to sentiment
in any shape, and he had borne as much
of it as he could well endure. So, from his throne
in Fritzy Nunky&#8217;s arms, he stooped and whispered
with startling distinctness: &#8220;I&#8217;m awful hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a relief that proved how close, after all,
is the bond between flesh and spirit, every other
member of the group promptly remembered that
he or she was hungry, too.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> days later, Fritz appeared in the kitchen,
only to be speedily informed by Rosetta that &#8220;I
hain&#8217;t no time to bother with young ones now!
Here, take a cookie if ye want it, an&#8217; clear out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a cookie, and I don&#8217;t want to
clear out. I want somebody to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk ter somebody &#8217;tain&#8217;t so busy as I be,
then! I&#8217;ve got about forty hundred things ter
do this very day, an&#8217; here it is goin&#8217; on ten
o&#8217;clock, a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What &#8216;forty hundered&#8217; things, Rosetta?
Paula says that you zaggerate turribly. I don&#8217;t
know ezactly what zaggerate means, but I&#8217;m
afraid it is somethin&#8217; like tellin&#8217; a lie. You
wouldn&#8217;t tell a lie, would you, Rosetta?&#8221; responded
the little boy, in a tone that revealed
his distress over Rosetta&#8217;s danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, if ye hev sunthin&#8217; ter do ye won&#8217;t ast
so many foolish questions. Take this bowl of
raisins an&#8217; set down an&#8217; stun &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>That was labor wholly congenial to Fritzy&#8217;s
temper, or he fancied that it would be, and he
obediently took the bowl and dropped upon the
floor to &#8220;help Rosetta,&#8221; as he had occasionally
been allowed to do before.</p>

<p>The good woman was indeed very busy. She
was a famous cook, but in all the time he had
been at The Snuggery, Fritz had never smelled
so many and such savory odors as permeated
her kitchen at that moment. In the great Dutch
oven, from &#8220;the hole in the wall,&#8221; as he called
it, there came whiffs of perfume suggesting
to the chronically hungry child the delights of
roasting fowls, and even the unusual but never-to-be-forgotten
fragrance of a &#8220;little piggy
cookin&#8217; whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>The range oven was full of pies, the shelves
of the pantry were laden with cakes and jellies,
and even the little oil-stove was pressed into service
to bake tin after tin of puffy looking biscuits.
Fritz didn&#8217;t understand it at all. And when he
had asked Content why every one was &#8220;tearin&#8217;
around as if they was possessed so for,&#8221; she had
answered him with honest sympathy:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea in the world, dearie.
It seems as if grandmother must be expecting a
lot of company; for even we couldn&#8217;t eat half
the stuff Rosetta is preparing. I asked Aunt
Ruth if any one was coming, and she told me to
&#8216;watch out sharp and see.&#8217; I knew then that I
was to ask no more questions; but I do hope we
shall have a taste of all the nice things; don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I?&#8221; responded Fritz; and with that
hope in mind he had invaded the kitchen.</p>

<p>Rosetta at last bethought herself that the child
was unusually quiet, and paused in her vigorous
thumping of the bread dough to look behind her
toward his corner. There was a goodly pile of
sticky seeds upon her polished floor; the bowl
of raisins had become a bowl of emptiness; but
in the basin which should have been filled, to
make all the terms of the problem satisfactory,
there were but a few torn and scraggy bits of
fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fritzy Pickel! What in the name o&#8217; common-sense!
Where hev ye put them raisins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where? Wh&mdash;why, in the basin,&#8221; answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the boy, bending forward and looking into it with
a perfectly satisfied expression on his dirty face.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say to put &#8217;em there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I did say; but, ye bad boy,
ye&#8217;ve put ten in yer mouth ter ary one went inter
the dish! I don&#8217;t want no more sech help, an&#8217; ef
my hands wasn&#8217;t all over dough, I&#8217;d fix ye!
Clear right out o&#8217; here, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz waited no second order. Rosetta&#8217;s face
was not a pleasant one at that instant; but when
he stopped to ask, from a prudently safe position
outside the doorway, what she was &#8220;a-cookin&#8217;
sech a lot for?&#8221; she replied savagely, if
with something like tears in her eyes: &#8220;I&#8217;m
a-cookin&#8217;&mdash;fer folks! But I&#8217;d a&#8217;most ruther do
it fer a fun&#8217;ral!&#8221;</p>

<p>More perplexed than ever, and with that sort
of feeling in his small stomach which demanded
sympathy, he wandered away into &#8220;grandmother&#8217;s
part&#8221; of the house. It was always
sunshiny and delightful in &#8220;grandmother&#8217;s part,&#8221;
and to it as a haven of rest the raisin-surfeited
youngster turned, secure of a reception that
would be kind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell grandma about that old Rosetta
thing! She&#8217;s crosser than cross!&#8221; But though
grandmother smiled sweetly upon her little grandson
as he entered, it was in an absent sort of way
which seemed rather the force of habit than of
welcome. She was talking with Fritzy Nunky;
and, as naturally as possible, Fritz second marched
to the uncle&#8217;s knee to be lifted up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nunky can&#8217;t take you now, little man. Run
away and read your books in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritzy was mad. And his stomach did begin
to feel very queer. He kept tasting raisins and
tasting them, till he felt as if he should never
care to see another. But as there was absolutely
nothing else to be done, he went to the corner
designated, and sat down to look at pictures.</p>

<p>Grandmother and Uncle Fritz paid no attention
to him; indeed, they quite forgot his presence,
and went on talking as if he were a nobody.
Fritz resented this at first; then he became
interested in what they were saying; and at a
word of Uncle Fritz about Munich and the
schools there, he sat up and listened intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Fritz!&#8221; said grandmother; and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
voice had rarely sounded so sharp. &#8220;Nay, thee
must not ask that. Thee is taking the light of
my eyes away from me in my old age, but thee
must leave me my children&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was queer, wasn&#8217;t it? Yet Uncle Fritz
appeared to be doing nothing but sitting there in
the easy-chair and looking straight upon the
carpet. Finally, he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou must not blame me, Mother Amy.
Thou shouldst blame thy own self, who hast made
her the lovely woman that she is. I could not
help but love her; and thou&mdash;thou must have
left thy mother&#8217;s side also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does thee think I will fight against nature,
Fritz? I blame nobody; but when thee and she
think to rob me of my little ones, then I will not
let thee have thy will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz second began to be very much interested,
indeed. He forgot all about the &#8220;raisiny-pain,&#8221;
and pictured pages were as dross. He knew
they were talking about &#8220;the children,&#8221; and that
included himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the care, think of the care. Even for
the six months that we shall be away it will be
too much for thy feeble strength.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said grandmother, and she said it
exactly like Aunt Ruth. &#8220;I am only seventy-seven
years of age. I have excellent health, and
my parents lived to be over ninety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If thou wouldst only go with us!&#8221; pleaded
Fritzy Nunky, eloquently.</p>

<p>Grandmother shook her head vigorously. &#8220;In
this house I have lived ever since my husband
left me. In this house I will remain till my own
summons comes. Having nobody else to cosset,
Ruth has cosseted me, and pretended to her
loving heart that I required it. I do not. I am
fully capable of caring for all those whom the
Lord sends to my keeping. I have thought it
all out. There shall come a governess here, and
the children shall be regularly taught all that it is
necessary they should know. Melville will be
with his great professor in a very few weeks, so
friend Winslow tells me. The rest of us will
abide in our place and be at peace. Go, thee
and Ruth, and be as happy as were my companion
and I. I could wish thee nothing more;
but take this step only in the fear of the
Lord.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Fritzy got up and walked softly to his grandmother&#8217;s
chair.</p>

<p>By that time Fritzy Nunky was pacing up the
long apartment and down again, in a very disturbed
sort of fashion. No wonder, Fritz the
second thought, if, as grandmother said, he was
really taking away from her the light of her eyes!
The child felt a sudden revulsion of feeling toward
his beloved guardian of which he might not
have been thought capable. He cast a scowling
glance upon the burly, striding figure, and wished
that he could fight it. Then he leaned his sticky
hands on Mother Amy&#8217;s knees and peered curiously
up into her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, little lad?&#8221; asked the old lady
gently, and bending down to kiss her darlings&#8217;
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he really doing it? What makes him?
And does it hurt you very much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doing what, Fritz?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taking the light out of your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, nay! not wholly so!&#8221; cried Grandmother
Amy, bending her face upon the sturdy
little shoulder of the child; &#8220;he cannot do that,
little one, while he leaves me thee.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Then Fritz climbed up into her lap, and
scowled ferociously at Uncle Fritz, who&mdash;terrified,
it may be&mdash;went quickly out and closed the
door.</p>

<p>But the hubbub of the kitchen did not extend
to the other parts of the great house; though,
strangely enough, Aunt Ruth seemed to have
found plenty of occupation for everybody&#8217;s hands;
though she assigned the various tasks with a sort
of gentle sadness which surprised the toilers, so
different was it from her usual brisk activity.
And when Octave had finished her allotted portion
she sped to Melville&#8217;s room to talk it over.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, there is another &#8216;Mystery&#8217; afoot. I
know it, I feel it! It&#8217;s &#8216;borne in on me.&#8217; There
has been food enough cooked to feed a regiment,
and every nook and cranny of this mansion has
been swept and garnished. Strangest part of all,
Aunt Ruth is in it; and I&#8217;m inclined to think
that Fritzy Nunky is too, for he acts so queer!
A few minutes ago he met me in the hall, and he
stopped me and kissed me. &#8216;I wonder if I am
doing right by thee, my child,&#8217; he said, in the
gravest fashion. I told him I considered that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
was doing exactly right; for this very morning
he called me into his room and gave me a pretty
silver watch, and a pocket-book with ten whole
dollars in it. Think of that, Melville Capers!
I, Octave Pickel, the impecunious, with ten real
dollars all my very own!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is almost incredible. But don&#8217;t worry;
you&#8217;ll not have them long; you have no liking
for money,&#8221; answered Melville, consolingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I do so like it&mdash;to spend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, think there is another &#8216;Mystery&#8217;;
but it can never be half so splendid as ours. I
think your Uncle Fritz is in it even more deeply
than Aunt Ruth. This morning, it must have
been after he had given you the pocket-book, he
came in to see me; and he talked to me so seriously
about my responsibility as the &#8216;head of the
family in America,&#8217; that I couldn&#8217;t believe my
own ears. It didn&#8217;t seem at all like his jolly
self; and, &#8216;Mystery&#8217; or not, I don&#8217;t believe
that these other conspirators are getting half as
much fun, or good either, out of it as we did
out of ours. There is a lot of company coming,
though, I know. Grandmother never had so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
much cooked before, Abry-ham says, even for
&#8216;yearly meeting,&#8217; when she has a houseful of
thees and thous.&#8221;</p>

<p>In came Paula, visibly excited, and in great
haste. &#8220;Octave, Aunt Ruth says we are to go
up stairs and put on our best dresses, for there
is company coming. A lot of old Quaker
Friends, and who do you think? Why, the great
doctor and the great professor and his wife, and
the village folks, and everybody you can think
of. I knew you&#8217;d have to mend your frock, for
you tore it the last time you had it on, so I
thought I&#8217;d tell you right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother! I hate company! I wanted
Octave to help me with some problems. We
haven&#8217;t had one single minute to study since the
folks came home!&#8221; exclaimed Melville, peevishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve borne that deprivation in an angelic
spirit,&#8221; retorted Octave; who found sitting
patiently to work out Melville&#8217;s incomprehensible
problems a terrible tax upon her restless spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Aunt Ruth beats me; she ought to be
in a perfect fever of nervousness, but she is as
calm&mdash;as calm!&#8221; said Melville, who had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
many unusual visits from her during that
morning. Visits which appeared to have no
special object, but which were apparently intended
as sympathetic,&mdash;that is, as far as Melville
could understand them.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner the expected guests began
to arrive; and even then Ruth was everywhere
about the house, receiving her friends and showing
them to the most comfortable seats in the
great, old-fashioned parlor, which had been
thrown open to the fresh September air, and
from which a door opening into Melville&#8217;s sitting-room
had been unlocked, for the first time in
many years. His cot had been rolled to this
doorway, and there he lay conversing with his
revered professor, who had promptly appeared
on the noon train.</p>

<p>The great surgeon and Uncle Fritz were deep
in the discussion of a &#8220;beautiful case&#8221; which
Fritz must be sure to see when he passed through
London.</p>

<p>London! Was he going away to it soon?
Octave felt her heart sink strangely; and she
unconsciously clutched little Fritz&#8217;s hand so that
he protested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>Then everybody came in from all the rooms
where they had been wandering; even Rosetta,
in a clean print gown, and Abry-ham in his Sunday
clothes, and Luke, smelling of bear&#8217;s oil and
pomatum. And they ranged themselves all
around the place, so &#8220;fer all the world like a
fun&#8217;ral&#8221; that Rosetta was seized then and there
with a desire to weep. When she did so, with
audible moans, it was high time to put an end to
the&mdash;&#8220;Mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, evidently, thought Uncle Fritz; for he
arose and, crossing to Aunt Ruth&#8217;s side, held out
his great hand invitingly.</p>

<p>Then she, looking like a sweet blush rose,
wrapped in a cloak of soft gray moss, stood up
and faced him; and before anybody could do
much more than sigh their amazement, those
two people had&mdash;married themselves!</p>

<p>So that was the &#8220;Mystery&#8221; then! A Quaker
wedding! &#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Melville; &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t
half so great as ours. <i>Anybody</i> can get married!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was such a deal of hand-shaking
and good-wishing that Octave couldn&#8217;t just bear
it. She was sorry and she was glad; and all she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
knew was that she was thankful when it was over,
and the whole family gathered in characteristic
groups to watch the misbehaving aunt and uncle
drive away.</p>

<p>There was Octave, supporting Melville so that
he could see through the window what others
witnessed from the doorway; &#8220;the girls,&#8221; with
Christina between them, clinging together on
the steps; and Fritzy, close beside Grandmother
Amy.</p>

<p>Aunt Ruth leaned far out of the carriage, and
her face was all a conflict of joy and pain.
&#8220;Fare thee well, my mother! Do not thee misjudge me,
and do&mdash;keep safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Aunt Ruthy, don&#8217;t you worry. <i>I&#8217;ll</i>
take care of her,&#8221; said little Fritz; and the last
glimpse Ruth caught of her home showed that
valiant lad with his arms about his grandmother&#8217;s
waist, and the protecting pride of manhood in
his honest blue eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NEW BOOKS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><b>A SCORE OF FAMOUS COMPOSERS.</b> By <span class="smcap">Nathan
Haskell Dole</span>, formerly musical editor of the Philadelphia <i>Press</i> and <i>Evening
Bulletin</i>. With portraits of Beethoven, Wagner, Liszt, Haydn, etc. 12mo, $1.50.</p>


<p>No pains have been spared to make this volume of musical biographies accurate, and at
the same time entertaining. Many quaint and curious details have been found in out-of-the-way
German or Italian sources. Beginning with Palestrina, &#8220;the Prince of Music,&#8221;
concerning whose life many interesting discoveries have been recently made, and ending
with Wagner, the twenty Composers, while in the majority of German origin, still embrace
representatives of England and Italy, Hungary and Russia, of France and Poland.
Free from pedantry and technicalities, simple and straightforward in style, these sketches
aim above all to acquaint the reader, and particularly the young, with the personality of
the subjects, to make them live again while recounting their struggles and triumphs.</p>



<p><b>FAMOUS ENGLISH STATESMEN.</b> By <span class="smcap">Sarah K. Bolton</span>,
author of &#8220;Poor Boys Who became Famous.&#8221; With Portraits of Gladstone,
John Bright, Robert Peel, etc. 12mo, $1.50.</p>


<p>Mrs. Bolton has found a peculiarly congenial subject in her latest contribution to the
series of &#8220;Famous&#8221; books. Nearly all of the English statesmen whose biographies she
so sympathetically recounts, have been leaders in great works of reform; and with many
Mrs. Bolton had the privilege of personal acquaintance. She has given succinct, yet sufficiently
detailed descriptions of the chief labors of these statesmen, and the young reader
will find them stirring and stimulating, full of anecdotes and bright sayings.</p>



<p><b>THE JO-BOAT BOYS.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">J. F. Cowan</span>, D.D., editor of
&#8220;Our Young People,&#8221; etc. Illustrated by H. W. Peirce. 12mo, $1.50.</p>


<p>The shanty boats which shelter the amphibious people along the banks of the Ohio are
called Jo-Boats, and Dr. Cowan has chosen this original environment for the earlier
scenes of his remarkably lively and spirited story. It will appeal to every boy who has a
spark of zest in his soul.</p>



<p><b>AN ENTIRE STRANGER.</b> By Rev. <span class="smcap">T. L. Baily</span>. Illustrated.
12mo, $1.25.</p>


<p>The heroine of Mr. Baily&#8217;s na&iuml;ve and fascinating story is a school-teacher who is full
of resources, and understands how to bring out the diverse capabilities of her scholars.
She wins the love and admiration of her school, and interests them in many improvements.
It is a thoroughly practical book, and we should be glad to see it in the hands of
all teachers and their scholars.</p>



<p><b>THROWN UPON HER OWN RESOURCES; OR,
WHAT GIRLS CAN DO.</b> By &#8220;<span class="smcap">Jenny June</span>&#8221; (Mrs.
Croly). A book for girls. 12mo, $1.25.</p>


<p>Mrs. Croly, the able editor of <i>The Home Maker</i>, in this book for girls, shows in her
practical, common-sense way, what chances there are open to young women, when the
necessity comes for self-support. The wise, prudent words of one who has had so much
experience in dealing with the problems of life will be welcomed by a large class of
readers.</p>



<p><b>LED IN UNKNOWN PATHS.</b> By <span class="smcap">Anna F. Raffensperger</span>.
Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25.</p>


<p>A simple, unpretentious diary of homely, every-day life. It is so true to nature that it
reads like a transcript from an actual journal. It is full of good-humor, quiet fun, gentle
pathos, and good sound sense. One follows with surprising interest the daily doings, the
pleasures and trials of the good family whose life is pictured in its pages.</p>



<p><b>HALF A DOZEN GIRLS.</b> By <span class="smcap">Anna Chapin Ray</span>, author of
&#8220;Half a Dozen Boys.&#8221; Illustrated. 12mo, $1.25.</p>


<p>A book for girls displaying unusual insight into human nature with a quiet, sly humor,
a faculty of investing every-day events with a dramatic interest, a photographic touch,
and a fine moral tone. It ought to be a favorite with many girls.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
